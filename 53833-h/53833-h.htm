<h2 id="c1"><i>AMERICAN UNITARIAN HYMNODY</i></h2>
<p>In the first edition of Julian&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary of Hymnology</i>
(1891) F. M. Bird<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> wrote, &ldquo;The Unitarians&mdash;possessing a large
share of the best blood and brain of the most cultivated section
of America&mdash;exhibit a long array of respectable hymnists whose
effusions have often won the acceptance of other bodies,&rdquo; (pp. 58-59).
And in this century Louis F. Benson<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a>
in his classic book <i>The English Hymn</i> (p. 460) wrote,
&ldquo;It is not surprizing that a body including the best blood
and highest culture of Massachusetts shared in the Literary Movement
[of the 19<sup>th</sup> century] and succeeded
in imparting to its hymn books a freshness of interest
in great contrast to those of the orthodox churches&rdquo; and that
&ldquo;from their [the compilers&rsquo;] hands there proceeded &mdash;&mdash; a series
of hymn books whose literary interest was very notable&rdquo; (p. 462).</p>
<p>This succession of Unitarian hymn writers over a period of
approximately 150 years can best be traced in the nearly 50 hymn
books compiled by individuals or committees for use in Unitarian
churches.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a>
The editors of these books were among the best
educated men of their time, who knew where to look for fresh
lyrical utterances of a living faith. The earliest of them
lived in the period when the traditional metrical psalms which,
for more than two centuries, had been almost the only worship-song
of the English speaking world, were being slowly superseded by
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
the songs of a new age. These songs they chiefly found in the
various hymn-books published for use in English Non-conformist
chapels when the Church of England still generally adhered to
the Old or New Versions of the Psalms. It was from these sources
that Jeremy Belknap first introduced to Americans the hymns of
Anne Steele, and included in his <i>Sacred Poetry</i> (1795) hymns by
Addison, Cowper, Newton, Doddridge and other English contemporaries.
When, in 1808, the vestry of Trinity Church, Boston, impatient
at the delay of the General Convention of the Protestant
Episcopal Church in getting out a hymnal, issued one for their
own use, they drew heavily upon Belknap&rsquo;s collection, saying in
their preface &ldquo;In this selection we are chiefly indebted to
Dr. Belknap, whose book unquestionably contains the best expressions
of sacred poetry extant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many of the later collections in this series of Unitarian
hymn books have been no less notable for their introduction to
use in this country of new English hymns, such as Pope&rsquo;s &ldquo;Father
of all, in every age;&rdquo; Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s &ldquo;When Israel of the
Lord beloved;&rdquo; translations of hymns in the Roman Breviary;
Sarah Flower Adams&rsquo; &ldquo;Nearer, my God, to Thee&rdquo; (only three years
after its publication in England); and Newman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lead, kindly
Light;&rdquo; and for the ability of their compilers to discover fresh
materials near at hand, as when Samuel Longfellow and Samuel
Johnson were the first to notice the hymnic possibilities of
Whittier&rsquo;s poems.</p>
<p>The story of American Unitarian hymnody begins with the
publication in 1783 of the <i>Collection of Hymns&mdash;designed for
the use of the West Society of Boston.</i> This church belonged to
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
the liberal wing of New England Congregationalism, destined
to become known as Unitarian a generation later. The book
contained a small selection of traditional psalms and hymns
by British authors and a number of quaintly didactic moral
ditties in doggerel, presumably contributed by Boston versifiers
who cannot now be identified.</p>
<p>The first group of Unitarian hymn-writers whose names are
known and whose productions have survived did not begin to write
until the opening decades of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Of this group
the earliest born was John Quincy Adams, (1767-1848), best
remembered as the sixth President of the United States. That
he was also a hymn writer, and the only president of the country
who was one, has generally been forgotten. Two or three hymns
by him were written earlier but most of them came from the period
following his retirement from the presidency in 1829. Soon after
that event he wrote one for the 200<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the First
Church in Quincy, of which he was a member, and later in life he
composed a metrical paraphrase of the whole Book of Psalms. When
Dr. Lunt, minister of the Quincy church, was preparing his
<i>Christian Psalter</i>, 1841, Mrs. Adams put into his hands the mss.
of her husband&rsquo;s poems, and Lunt included in his book five hymns
and seventeen psalms by his distinguished parishioner. None of
them rose above the level of respectable verse but his version
of Psalm 43 survived in one or more hymn books 100 years later.</p>
<p>Rev. John Pierpont (1785-1866) was a poet of considerable
abilities whose verses were in demand for special occasions and
whose hymns were the best lyrical expressions of the developing
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
new thought in religion. W. Garrett Horder, the English
hymnologist, wrote that Pierpont&rsquo;s hymn of universal praise
was &ldquo;the earliest really great hymn I have found by an American
author.&rdquo; It is still in use, as are two others by him.</p>
<p>Prof. Andrews Norton (1786-1853) of the Harvard Divinity
School, published a hymn as early as 1809 and a good deal of
verse in later years, much of it in a rather sombre introspective
mood, but with one fine hymn still in use. He was followed
by Rev. Nathaniel Langdon Frothingham (1793-1870) who wrote
a good many hymns for special occasions, one of which survives
today, and by Rev. Henry Ware, Jr. (1794-1843) who wrote a number
of hymns highly valued as utterances of the religious idealism
of the period, but long since dropped from use, except for an
excellent one for the dedication of an organ, probably the only
hymn in the English language written expressly for such an occasion.
William Cullen Bryant (1794-1878), a lay man of letters,
was another of the elder members of the famous group of New
England poets of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, and as early as 1820 he contributed
5 hymns to Sewall&rsquo;s <i>New York Collection</i>, published in
that year, and he later wrote others.</p>
<p>The latest born of this first group who attained memorable
distinction in this field was Rev. Frederic Henry Hedge (1805-1890),
whose earliest hymn, still in use, was written in 1829,
but who is best known for his great translation of Luther&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Ein&rsquo; feste Burg,&rdquo; and for a fine Good Friday hymn. He collaborated
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
with Rev. Frederic Dan Huntington<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> (1819-1904) then
the college preacher at Harvard, in compiling <i>Hymns for the
Church of Christ</i>, (1853), to which Huntington contributed
five hymns, none now in use. Their book was the last and best
of the various <i>Collections</i> published up to the middle of the
century by editors who belonged to what was becoming the conservative
wing of the denomination, to whom Emerson&rsquo;s <i>Divinity
School Address</i> of 1838 seemed dangerously radical.</p>
<p>But meantime a new era in Unitarian hymnody was opening
with the publication in 1846 of the <i>Book of Hymns</i> edited by
Samuel Longfellow (1819-1891) and Samuel Johnson (1822-1882),
while they were still studying in the Harvard Divinity School.
Both had come under the influence of the Transcendentalist
movement which was liberalizing Unitarian thought and they
eagerly sought out hymns which were fresh expressions of their
youthful outlook on religion. The book was notable for the
new sources of hymns which they discovered, among them the
poems of John Greenleaf Whittier, which they were the first
to introduce into a hymn book.</p>
<p>Their <i>Book of Hymns</i> was followed in 1864 by their larger
and even more influential <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>, which includes
most of their own hymns and many by other Unitarian writers of
the period, too numerous to name here, but whose hymns are
listed in the <a href="#c3">catalogue of writers</a> appended to this introductory
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
sketch. Samuel Johnson wrote only half a dozen hymns, but
they are among the finest in the language. Samuel Longfellow
wrote many more, the best of which are quite equal to Johnson&rsquo;s,
and together they made a more important contribution to American
Unitarian hymnody than that of any other writers in the middle
of the 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>This was the period of &ldquo;the flowering of New England literature&rdquo;
and two of its poets, besides those already named, made
their contribution to hymnody. The more important of the two
was Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, (1809-1894) with half a dozen
fine and widely used hymns, and Prof. James Russell Lowell
(1819-1891) who, strictly speaking, was hardly a hymn writer at
all, but from whose poems two or three have been quarried. Two
other writers of this period were Rev. Edmund Hamilton Sears
(1810-1876) and his niece, Miss Eliza Scudder (1819-1896).
Sears wrote two Christmas hymns widely used throughout the
English speaking world. Miss Scudder wrote half a dozen hymns
in a mystical vein of the highest quality, but in temperament
and outlook both writers belong more to the earlier period of
Unitarian thought than to that prevalent in their later lifetime.</p>
<p>In this mid-century period should also be included the
famous war-time hymn by Mrs. Julia Ward Howe (1819-1910), &ldquo;Mine
eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord,&rdquo; written in
1861 to provide worthier words than &ldquo;John Brown&rsquo;s body&rdquo; for the
popular tune &ldquo;Glory, Hallelujah&rdquo;, which had been composed a few
years earlier for a Sunday School in Charleston, South Carolina.</p>
<p>A third period in Unitarian hymnody began with the appearance
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
of hymns by three good friends, Rev. John White Chadwick
(1840-1906), Rev. Frederic Lucian Hosmer (1840-1929) and Rev.
William Channing Gannett (1840-1923), who carried forward in
the last third of the century the broadly theistic interpretation
of a universal religion to which Longfellow and Johnson
had given utterance. Chadwick&rsquo;s first hymn was written in 1864
for the graduation of his class from the Harvard Divinity School,
a great hymn of brotherhood, widely used in England as well as
here. A half-dozen others of fine quality have survived. Hosmer
and Gannett worked together in bringing out their book <i>The
Thought of God in Hymns and Poems</i>, 1885, 1894, and <i>Unity Hymns
and Chorals</i>, 1880, 1911. Neither wrote any hymns while in the Divinity School, but both began to do so soon after. In 1873
Gannett wrote a fine one which is probably the earliest in the
language to give a religious interpretation to the then controversial
doctrine of evolution, and later a half dozen others to
which deep feeling is expressed in beautiful lyrical verse.
Hosmer, however, was a much more prolific writer, producing more
than 40 hymns which have had some use. He was a meticulous
craftsman who studied the technique of hymn-writing, and several
of his hymns are among the finest in the language. Canon Dearmer,
a leading authority on hymnody in the Church of England, included
seven of them in his <i>Songs of Praise</i> and calls one of them &ldquo;this
flawless poem, one of the completest expressions of religious
faith,&rdquo; and says another is &ldquo;one of the noblest hymns in the
language.&rdquo; For approximately 40 years, c. 1880-1920, Hosmer was
the outstanding hymn writer in the English speaking world, and
he left no successor who was his equal in the perfection of his
finest hymns.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>A smaller but important contribution to the Unitarian hymnody
of this period was made by Rev. Theodore Chickering Williams
(1855-1915) who, while still a student in the Harvard Divinity
School wrote one of the best ordination hymns in the language,
and, in later years, eight others, still in use, which are
religious poetry of a high order.</p>
<p>The latest period in Unitarian hymnody, covering the last
half-century, is notable for the productions of two writers,
Rev. Marion Franklin Ham (1867-1957) and Rev. John Haynes Holmes,
(1879-still living). Although he had published a volume of
poems in 1896 Dr. Ham did not begin to write hymns until 1911,
but thereafter he produced a succession of beautiful religious
lyrics, eight or ten of which have come into use. Some of them
are utterances of a profound mystical insight akin to that of
Eliza Scudder, but others are expressions of a world-wide theism,
and one has been translated into Japanese.</p>
<p>Rev. John Haynes Holmes has been a more prolific writer,
author of about 45 hymns, many written for special occasions,
but 10 or 15 others have come into general and widespread use.
His hymns are in a quite different key from those of Dr. Ham&rsquo;s
quiet mysticism, generally being stirring calls to social justice
and the service of mankind, though a few are hymns of gratitude
for the simple joys of life. While he has infrequently attained
the felicity of phrasing which results in a memorable line his
hymns are cast in vigorous and often stirring verse, expressing
a noble altruism and a wholesome attitude towards life.</p>
<p>M. F. Ham and J. H. Holmes are the latest notable figures in
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
this era of 150 years since the beginning of American Unitarian
hymnody, throughout which scores of lesser writers have also
contributed their offerings to the main stream. These writers
are far too numerous to name in this outline sketch but their
thumbnail biographies and notations as to their hymns will be
found in the following catalogue. A survey of this whole era
discloses the evolution in liberal religious thought from the
period when the emphasis was on the sinfulness of man and the
redemptive function of the Christian Church, to the vision of
a world wide religion taking in many forms, and manifested in that
service of mankind which found expression in the &ldquo;social gospel&rdquo;
in the first half of this century.</p>
<p>The production of so great a number of fine hymns (and of a
long series of hymn books of a superior type) over so long a period,
by persons belonging to one of the smallest Protestant denominations,
commonly considered coldly intellectual rather than emotional in its
approach to religion, is a phenomenon unique in the history of
hymnody. When the first edition of the <i>Pilgrim Hymnal</i> was published
in 1910 it listed both the nationality and the church membership
of the authors included, which led to the disclosure that nearly
half the American authors were Unitarians who had contributed considerably
more than half the hymns of American authorship. In
answer to critics Dr. Washington Gladden replied that this was due
to the simple fact that the Unitarians had written a larger number
of the best hymns than had the American writers in other denominations.</p>
<p>Canon Dearmer in England observed the same fact and was
puzzled to explain it. The explanation, however, is a simple one.
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
With the exception of a relatively small number of writers born
in other parts of the country and with different backgrounds, these
Unitarian authors were men brought up in the atmosphere of the so-called
&ldquo;New England Renaissance,&rdquo; that literary revival of which
Boston, Cambridge and Concord were the chief centres in the 19<sup>th</sup>
century, and they belonged by blood, by education and by social
ties to the New England literary group. The majority were also
graduates of Harvard College or Harvard Divinity School, or both,
in a period when the spirit of the time was most favorable to the
stimulation of poetic gifts, and in a place where the intellectual
level was high and there was freedom from any dogmatic control.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a>
Thus they had the culture and the warmth of atmosphere needed, and
the Divinity School had the admirable custom of encouraging students
to write a hymn for the annual graduation exercises or for the
School&rsquo;s Christmas service, and so stimulated their poetic gifts.</p>
<p>Thanks to these favorable circumstances what has been called
&ldquo;the Harvard school of hymnody&rdquo; has had no equal in the English
speaking world, the only comparable institution being Trinity
College, Cambridge, England, which, for a much briefer period
(1820-1845) was the nursing mother of a notable succession of
Anglican hymn writers. It was this fact which led W. Garrett
Horder, an English Congregationalist who was also a highly competent
hymnologist, to write, &ldquo;Harvard, like our English Cambridge,
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
has been &lsquo;a nest of singing birds&rsquo;. I was struck by this when
editing <i>The Treasury of American Sacred Songs</i>. Harvard provided
the bulk &mdash;&mdash; of the verse I included.&rdquo; And other orthodox authorities,
notably F. M. Bird and Louis F. Benson, already quoted, have
borne witness to the high achievements of both the editors of the
long succession of Unitarian hymn books and the authors of the
hymns which they included.</p>

<p>In the 17<sup>th</sup> century, and down to the middle of the 18<sup>th</sup>,
all churches of the Congregational order in New England used
the <i>Bay Psalm Book</i>, first printed in Cambridge in 1640, except
for the use of Ainsworth&rsquo;s <i>Psalter</i> in the churches of the
Plymouth Plantation and in the First Church in Salem for a part
of the 17<sup>th</sup> century. In the latter part of the 18<sup>th</sup> century,
the <i>Bay Psalm Book</i> was gradually superseded by either the New
Version of the Psalms (Tate and Brady) or, more generally, by
one of the editions of <i>Watts and Select</i>, i.e. Isaac Watts&rsquo; <i>Psalms
and Hymns</i>, with a supplement of hymns selected from other authors.</p>
<p>The first steps away from the Psalm books in general use
were taken by two churches which were in the vanguard of the rising
liberalism of the last half of the 18<sup>th</sup> century. In 1782 the
West Church in Boston published <i>A Collection of Hymns, more particularly
designed for the Use of the West Society in Boston</i> <a href="#hbk1">(1)</a>,<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a>
and in 1788 the East Church in Salem published <i>A Collection of
Hymns for Publick Worship</i>, <a href="#hbk2">(2)</a>. These two books were of only
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
local significance, but they clearly pointed the way which later
publications were to follow. In 1795 Rev. Jeremy Belknap brought
out his <i>Sacred Poetry</i> <a href="#hbk3">(3)</a>, which was an attempt to produce a book
which should be acceptable to both the liberal and the orthodox
wings of Congregationalism. In this purpose it failed, though
it was widely used by Unitarians. The succeeding books were more
definitely Unitarian in character and illustrate the changing
emphasis in religious thought and practice through five generations
of religious liberals. They form a notable series, for
most of them attained a literary standard and spiritual outlook
higher than that of other contemporary hymn books.</p>
<p>The earlier books in this series were very imperfectly
edited, judged by modern standards. Some of them contain no
preface and no indication as to the identity of the compiler. In
other cases, the compiler is indicated by initials. In some cases
the names of the authors of hymns are not given at all, in others
only the surname, when known, and there are frequent mistaken attributions.
Directions as to the music are usually lacking, the metre
of each hymn alone being indicated. In some cases the names of
suitable tunes are given, but only one book <a href="#hbk18">(18)</a> earlier than 1868
included any music, in that case an appendix of twenty-one tunes
in two parts at the back of the book. The first American Unitarian
hymn book to be printed with a tune on each page was the American
Unitarian Association&rsquo;s <i>Hymn and Tune Book</i> of 1868 <a href="#hbk34">(34)</a>. Thereafter
few books appeared without tunes, but half-a-dozen other
collections with music were published in the next forty years, each
of which had considerable use.</p>
<p>It will be noted that in the course of the 19<sup>th</sup> century no
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
less than thirty-six different hymn-books appeared, a far larger
number than any other American denomination can show for the
same period, and illustrative of the extreme individualism of
the Unitarian churches. Throughout the middle third of the
century Greenwood&rsquo;s <i>Collection</i> <a href="#hbk13">(13)</a>, the <i>Springfield Collection</i>
<a href="#hbk14">(14)</a>, and the <i>Cheshire Collection</i> <a href="#hbk20">(20)</a>, had the widest use,
followed in the last third of the century by the <i>Hymn and Tune
Books</i> <a href="#hbk34">(34)</a> and <a href="#hbk36">(36)</a> of the American Unitarian Association, but all
the other collections had some local vogue, in some cases only
for a brief period or only in those churches the ministers of which
had compiled the collections in question. As late, however, as
the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, at least eight different hymn-books
were in use in the Unitarian churches of the United States
and Canada. This diversity of usage declined rapidly after the
publication of <i>The New Hymn and Tune Book</i> <a href="#hbk45">(45)</a> in 1914, and had
practically disappeared by the time when that book&rsquo;s successor,
<i>Hymns of the Spirit</i> <a href="#hbk48">(48)</a> was published in 1937.</p>

contains 166 hymns, including a number of classics by Watts,

<p class="hbook" id="hbk3">3. <i>Sacred Poetry: consisting of Psalms and Hymns adapted to
Christian devotion in publick and private. Selected from the
best authors, with variations and additions</i>&mdash;By Jeremy Belknap,
D.D., Boston, 1795.</p>
<p class="hbookc">Many editions. Some included a supplement of <i>Hymns for the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper, selected and original</i>, <a href="#hbk7">(7)</a> prepared by Rev.
Thaddeus M. Harris, minister of the First Church in Dorchester,
1801. In 1812 an edition appeared with 28 additional hymns,
&ldquo;Selected by the successor of the Rev. Author,&rdquo; i.e. by W. E.
Channing.</p>
<p class="hbookc">Dr. Belknap (1744-1798) was the first Congregational minister
of the Federal Street Church (his predecessors having been Presbyterians),
and his immediate successor was William Ellery Channing.
Belknap endeavored to compile a collection which should serve both
the orthodox and the liberal wings of the New England Congregationalism
of his day. In his preface he says, &ldquo;In this selection, those
Christians who do not scruple to sing praises to their Redeemer
and Sanctifier, will find materials for such a sublime enjoyment;
whilst others, whose tenderness of conscience may oblige them to
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
confine their addresses to the Father only, will find no deficiency
of matter suited to their idea of the chaste and awful
spirit of devotion.&rdquo; Belknap, however, failed in his attempt to
produce a compromise book, as it found favor only in the liberal
churches, which used it for some forty years.</p>
<p class="hbookc">The book contains 150 psalms, selected from versions by Tate
and Brady, Watts, and others, often &ldquo;with variations&rdquo;; and 300
hymns, widely selected from English sources, including Pope&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Universal Prayer&rdquo; (altered), Helen Maria Williams&rsquo; &ldquo;While Thee
I seek, protecting Power,&rdquo; hymns by Cowper, Newton, Doddridge,
Merrick, Addison, Anne Steele and others. Belknap introduced
Anne Steele&rsquo;s hymns to Americans. There are no hymns by Charles
Wesley, and the only hymns of American authorship appear to be
Mather Byles&rsquo; &ldquo;When wild confusion rends the air,&rdquo; and a metrical
version of Psalm 65 by Jacob Kimball.</p>
<p class="hbookc">There are no musical directions save the metre of each hymn and
the key. &ldquo;The characters denoting the sharp or flat key are prefixed
to each psalm or hymn, at my request, by the Rev. Dr. Morse,
of Charlestown.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="hbookc">The book was much the best of its period. When, in 1808,
the vestry of Trinity Church, Boston, impatient at the delay of
the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in
getting out a hymnal, issued one for their own use, they drew
heavily on Belknap&rsquo;s, saying in their preface, &ldquo;In this selection
we are chiefly indebted to Dr. Belknap, whose book unquestionably
contains the best specimens of sacred poetry extant.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk4">4. <i>A Collection of Psalms and Hymns for public worship.</i>&mdash;Boston,
1799; edited by Rev. James Freeman (1759-1825). 2nd ed., 1813.</p>
<p class="hbookc">This was the first of the hymn-books prepared for use in King&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
Chapel, Boston, where it was used for 30 years until succeeded by
Greenwood&rsquo;s <i>Collection</i> <a href="#hbk13">(13)</a>. No preface; no musical directions
except that the metre is indicated. The names of some authors
are given in the index of first lines. The book contains 155
psalms, or parts of psalms, &ldquo;selected principally from Tate
and Brady,&rdquo; followed by 90 hymns and 8 doxologies. The collection
is decidedly inferior to that of Belknap <a href="#hbk3">(3)</a> in range and
quality.</p>

<p class="hbook" id="hbk5">5. <i>A Collection of Psalms and Hymns</i>&mdash;by William Emerson,
<span class="sc">A.M.</span>, Pastor of the First Church in Boston; Boston, 1808.</p>
<p class="hbookc">Rev. William Emerson (1769-1811) was the father of Ralph
Waldo Emerson. His book is more handsomely printed than most
hymn books of the period and contains 150 hymns. It was very
liberal in tone and was assailed by the orthodox for having
omitted hymns on several of &ldquo;the most essential doctrines of
Christianity.&rdquo; Its most notable feature was its endeavor to
improve the singing by &ldquo;prefixing to each psalm and hymn the
name of a tune, well composed and judicially chosen&rdquo; as &ldquo;a
valuable auxiliary to musical bands. No American hymn-book has
hitherto offered this aid to the performers of psalmody.&rdquo; The
key in which the tune is set and the metre are also indicated
at the head of each hymn. There is also an interesting &ldquo;Index
of Tunes, and Musical Authors,&rdquo; with references to the various
collections in which the recommended tunes may be found. As this
list of collections of tunes was prepared by a person particularly
interested in promoting good music it is here reprinted as indicating
the best available sources at the time:</p>

Newb&rsquo;t Coll., Newburyport Collection; Mus. Olio, Musical Olio;

<p class="hbookc">While this book thus made the selection of tunes easier than
did most of its contemporaries, it is needless to point out how
inconvenient it was not to have the tunes in the same book with
the words. With all its excellencies the book had small use,
being rather too far in advance of its time.</p>

It contains 518 hymns, and 7 chants, the latter being a feature not
met with in any earlier book in this series. Tunes are indicated
for each hymn, but the editor had some peculiar theories about
the &ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo; of words and music. The editor, Rev. Samuel
Willard (1776-1859), had been minister at Deerfield but had retired
on account of blindness and was temporarily resident in Hingham
when this book was published.</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk13">13. <i>A Collection of Psalms and Hymns for Christian Worship</i>&mdash;Boston:
Carter and Hendee, 1830.</p>
<p class="hbookc">Edited by Rev. Francis William Pitt Greenwood (1797-1843),
minister of King&rsquo;s Chapel, Boston. <i>Greenwood&rsquo;s Collection</i>, as it
was generally called, containing 560 psalms and hymns, superseded
Belknap&rsquo;s <a href="#hbk3">(3)</a> as the hymn-book most widely used in Unitarian
churches in the first half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. It ran to fifty
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
editions and was used in King&rsquo;s Chapel, for which it was prepared,
until superseded there by <i>Hymns of the Church Universal</i>, 1890, <a href="#hbk39">(39)</a>.
Based upon Watts, the book contains the then very recent hymns by
James Montgomery, Harriet Auber, Bowring and Heber, and practically
introduced Charles Wesley to American Unitarians. In <i>Young
Emerson Speaks</i>, edited by A. C. McGiffert, 1937, pages 145-150,
will be found a sermon on &ldquo;Hymn Books&rdquo; preached by R. W. Emerson in
1831, while still minister of the Second Church in Boston, in
which he recommends the church to adopt <i>Greenwood&rsquo;s Collection</i>
in place of Belknap&rsquo;s. Emerson, in his Journal for 1847, noted
that <i>Greenwood&rsquo;s Collection</i> was &ldquo;still the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk14">14. <i>The Springfield Collection of Hymns for sacred worship</i>, by
William B. O. Peabody&mdash;Springfield: Samuel Bowles, 1835.</p>
<p class="hbookc">Rev. William Oliver Bourne Peabody (1799-1847) was minister
at Springfield, Mass. His collection contains 509 hymns, admirably
chosen from the accepted classics of the period, Watts and Doddridge
predominant, but with an increasing number of the recent compositions
by Unitarian hymn-writers of the first third of the 19<sup>th</sup>
century. No musical instructions beyond indication of metres.
On its merits the <i>Springfield Collection</i> rightly shared with
<i>Greenwood&rsquo;s Collection</i> <a href="#hbk13">(13)</a> and <i>The Cheshire Collection</i> <a href="#hbk20">(20)</a> the
largest measure of popularity and use among Unitarians in the
middle of the 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk15">15. <i>The Christian Psalter: A Collection of Psalms and Hymns
for social and private worship</i>&mdash;Boston, 1841.</p>
<p class="hbookc">Edited by Rev. William Parsons Lunt (1805-1857), for use in
the First Church in Quincy, Mass. It contains 702 hymns and psalms and
represents a reversion to the older type of hymnody, &ldquo;but, if old-fashioned,
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
it was excellent and serviceable.&rdquo; Lunt included
22 pieces by his parishioner, ex-President John Quincy Adams,
whose wife had put into his hands a complete metrical psalter
which Adams had composed. At least one of Adams&rsquo; psalms is
still to be found in some hymn-books.</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk16">16. <i>A Manual of Prayer for public and private worship, with a
collection of hymns</i>&mdash;Boston, 1842.</p>
<p class="hbookc">Edited by Rev. William Greenleaf Eliot (1811-1887). Although
printed in Boston, this book was prepared for The First Congregational
Society of St. Louis, Missouri, of which the editor had
become minister in 1834. The Society was the earliest Unitarian
church in the Mississippi Valley, excepting that at New Orleans.
The book is primarily a collection of service materials followed
by 272 well-selected hymns from standard sources. It was the
earliest volume of the sort to be prepared for Unitarian use in
the Middle West.</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk17">17. <i>A Collection of Hymns, for the Christian Church and Home</i>&mdash;Boston,
1843.</p>
<p class="hbookc">Edited by Rev. James Flint (1779-1855). The editor was
minister of the East Church in Salem, Mass., and based his book
upon the 18<sup>th</sup> century collection of his predecessor, William
Bentley <a href="#hbk2">(2)</a>. He borrowed the title and much of the contents of
James Martineau&rsquo;s book published in England in 1840. The book
contains 415 hymns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note:&mdash;The American Unitarian Association does not own a copy
of this book. One is in the Congregational Library,
14 Beacon Street, Boston.</p>

<p class="hbook" id="hbk18">18. <i>The Social Hymn Book; consisting of psalms and hymns for
social worship and private devotions</i>&mdash;Boston, 1843.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p class="hbookc">Edited by Rev. Chandler Robbins (1810-1882), minister of
the Second Church in Boston. The book, which contains 350 psalms
and hymns, is based upon Watts and Doddridge, but it introduced
new hymns from various sources, among them about twenty of Bishop
Mant&rsquo;s translations of &ldquo;ancient hymns&rdquo; from the Roman Breviary.
Dr. Robbins was one of the earliest American hymn-book editors
to avail himself of the English versions of Latin hymns which
were among the fruits of the Oxford Movement. His book has an
appendix of 21 tunes in two parts, the book being thus the first
in this series to include any printed music.</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk19">19. <i>The Disciples&rsquo; Hymn Book; a collection of hymns and chants
for public and private devotions, prepared for the use of the
Church of the Disciples</i>&mdash;Boston, 1844.</p>
<p class="hbookc">Edited by Rev. James Freeman Clarke (1810-1888) for use in
the Church of the Disciples, Boston, which had been organized in
1841 and of which he was the first minister. The first edition
is commonly bound up with <i>Service Book: for the use of the Church
of the Disciples</i>. A revised and enlarged edition appeared in 1852.
The collection contains 318 hymns and an appendix of chants. It
was notable for its freshness and progressive outlook, and drew
upon the most recent English sources. It introduced into American
use the hymn &ldquo;Nearer, my God, to thee,&rdquo; by Sarah Flower Adams, published
in England only three years earlier, and other hymns by the
same author. It also included some of Clarke&rsquo;s own hymns, more of
which appeared in the second edition.</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk20">20. <i>Christian Hymns for public and private worship. A Collection
compiled by a committee of the Cheshire Pastoral Association</i>&mdash;Boston,
1845.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p class="hbookc">Edited by Rev. Abiel Abbott Livermore (1811-1892), Chairman;
Rev. Levi W. Leonard (1790-1864), Rev. William A. Whitwell
(1804-1865) and Rev. Curtis Cutler (1806-1874), ministers at
Keene, Dublin, Wilton, and Peterboro, New Hampshire, respectively.
The editorial work was chiefly done by Livermore, who also contributed
to it his communion hymn, &ldquo;A holy air is breathing round.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="hbookc">This book, commonly called <i>The Cheshire Collection</i>, ran
through sixty editions and was widely used. Its popularity was
due in part to its wide range&mdash;908 hymns&mdash;and to its provision
for special occasions, but more to the inclusion of fresh material
of high quality.</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk21">21. <i>A Collection of Psalms and Hymns for the Sanctuary</i>&mdash;Boston,
1845.</p>
<p class="hbookc">Edited by Rev. George E. Ellis (1814-1894) for use in the
Harvard Church in Charlestown, Mass., of which he was then minister.
It contains 658 hymns and psalms, and is based on <i>Greenwood&rsquo;s Collection</i>
<a href="#hbk13">(13)</a> and <i>The Springfield Collection</i> <a href="#hbk14">(14)</a>. A Selection from
the Psalms, apparently intended for responsive reading, is bound up
with the hymn-book, of which it is an unusual feature.</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk22">22. <i>Hymns for Public Worship</i>&mdash;Boston, 1845.</p>
<p class="hbookc">Edited by Rev. George W. Briggs (1810-1895), minister of the
First Church at Plymouth, Mass. (1838-1852). The book contains
601 hymns; no musical directions beyond indication of metres. There
is a strong emphasis on hymns of the inner life, the compiler having
sought &ldquo;to bring together the most fervent expressions of a profound
spiritual life,&rdquo; many of which &ldquo;have never been in familiar use in
Unitarian churches.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk23">23. <i>Service Book: for the Church of the Saviour, with a Collection
of Psalms and Hymns for Christian Worship</i>&mdash;Boston, 1845.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p class="hbookc">Edited by Rev. Robert Cassie Waterston (1812-1893), minister
of the Church of the Saviour, Boston. <i>The Collection of Psalms
and Hymns</i> bound up with the services is <i>Greenwood&rsquo;s Collection</i> <a href="#hbk13">(13)</a>
with a supplement of 116 hymns selected by Waterston, so that the
book is more accurately described as one of the editions of Greenwood
than as an independent publication. The supplement, however,
is notable for the high proportion of good new hymns, not available
when <i>Greenwood&rsquo;s Collection</i> first appeared. Among them are
hymns by Samuel F. Smith, G. W. Doane, the early and mid-century
Unitarian writers, and some taken from Breviary sources.</p>
<p class="hbookc">No musical instructions beyond indication of the metres.</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk24">24. <i>A Book of Hymns for public and private devotion</i>&mdash;Cambridge:
Metcalf &amp; Company, printers to the University. 1846.</p>
<p class="hbookc">Edited by Samuel Longfellow (1819-1892) and Samuel Johnson
(1822-1882). The editors were, at the time, students in the
Harvard Divinity School (class of 1846), and the book &ldquo;grew out
of an offer to provide a new book for a minister who found even
the recent ones too antiquated.&rdquo; It was marked by poetic excellence
and freshness, and introduced to American use &ldquo;Lead,
Kindly Light,&rdquo; and hymns by Whittier, Longfellow, Lowell, Jones
Very, Mrs. Stowe and others, besides hymns by the editors themselves.
First used in Church of the Unity, Worcester, Mass., of which
Edward Everett Hale was minister; then in the Music Hall congregation
of Theodore Parker, who is said, on receiving a copy, to have
remarked, &ldquo;I see we have a new book of Sams.&rdquo; It ran to a twelfth
edition in two years, but its greatest influence was as a source-book
for later editors. A somewhat enlarged edition appeared in
1848.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk25">25. <i>Hymns of the Sanctuary</i>&mdash;Boston, 1849.</p>
<p class="hbookc">Edited by Rev. Cyrus A. Bartol (1813-1900), minister of the
West Church in Boston, assisted by Charles G. Loring, Joseph
Willard, and other laymen of the church. The book is a revised
and enlarged edition of the &ldquo;West Boston Collection&rdquo; <a href="#hbk10">(10)</a> of
which the original edition had been prepared by Rev. Simeon Howard
<a href="#hbk1">(1)</a>. It contains 643 hymns and a few chants. No musical directions
beyond indication of metres.</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk26">26. <i>Hymns for the Church of Christ</i>&mdash;Edited by Rev. Frederic H.
Hedge and Rev. Frederic D. Huntington, Boston, 1853.</p>
<p class="hbookc">Frederic Henry Hedge (1805-1890) later became a distinguished
professor in the Harvard Divinity School. Frederic Dan Huntington
(1819-1904) later joined the Episcopal Church, in which he attained
a bishopric.</p>
<p class="hbookc">The book contains 872 hymns,&mdash;no musical instructions beyond
indication of metres. It is conservative in tone but is marked by
high literary standards, and by a catholic inclusiveness beyond
that of most books in this series. It includes a number of translations
of Breviary hymns, and in it appears, for the first time,
Hedge&rsquo;s translation of Luther&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ein&rsquo; feste Burg.&rdquo; Better printed
than most contemporary hymn-books, it was hailed as &ldquo;much the best
book of hymns yet published.&rdquo; Many hymns are listed as &ldquo;Anon.&rdquo; and
some authors are given by surname only, making identification doubtful.</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk27">27. <i>Services and Hymns for the use of the Unitarian Church of
Charleston</i>, S.C., 1854, 1867.</p>
<p class="hbookc">The preface to the first edition, dated &ldquo;April, 1854,&rdquo; was
signed by S. Gilman and C. M. Taggart, then joint ministers of the
church. No copy of this edition appears to be extant. A new and
enlarged edition, with an unsigned preface but reprinting the earlier
preface signed by Gilman and Taggart, appeared in 1867, &ldquo;Printed
by Joseph Walker, Agt., Charleston.&rdquo; &ldquo;Hymns for Christian Worship,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
171 in number, make up the second half of this volume. Almost
all of them are the standard English hymns in current use in the
first half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, with 10 hymns by American authors,
three of which are by Dr. Gilman and two by his wife, Caroline
Gilman, all of which had appeared in earlier collections.</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk28">28. <i>Hymn Book for Christian Worship</i>&mdash;Boston, 1854.</p>
<p class="hbookc">There is no preface and the name of the compiler nowhere
appears. It was, however, edited by Rev. Chandler Robbins (1810-1882),
minister of the Second Church in Boston, and is, in effect,
an enlargement of his earlier <i>Social Hymn Book</i>, <a href="#hbk18">(18)</a>, with 761
hymns, better adapted to church use. Like its predecessor, it
contained chiefly the older type of hymns,&mdash;107 by Watts, 62 by
Doddridge, 40 by James Montgomery, 13 by C. Wesley, and 20 more
called &ldquo;Wesleyan.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk29">29. <i>The Soldier&rsquo;s Companion: Dedicated to the Defenders of their
Country in the Field, by their Friends at Home</i>, published as the
issue of <i>The Monthly Journal</i>, Boston, for October, 1861, vol. II,
No. 10.</p>
<p class="hbookc">This was a small paper bound collection of a few traditional
hymns, supplemented by a dozen anti-slavery or wartime songs by
living writers, including J. Pierpont, E. H. Sears, and J. R. Lowell,
with a supplement of devotional readings and prayers. Presumably
it had some use in the Army, but copies are now very rare.</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk30">30. <i>Christian Worship</i>&mdash;New York, 1862.</p>
<p class="hbookc">Edited by Rev. Samuel Osgood (1812-1880), then minister of
the Church of the Messiah, New York, and Rev. Frederic A. Farley
(1800-1892), minister of The First Unitarian Congregational Church,
Brooklyn, N. Y.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p class="hbookc">A small collection of 159 hymns, bound up with a liturgical
type of service-book indicating the trend which later took
Osgood into the Episcopal Church.</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk31">31. <i>The Soldier&rsquo;s Hymn Book, containing a supplement of national
songs for the use of chaplains and soldiers in the army and navy
of the United States</i>&mdash;Prepared by J. G. Forman, Chaplain of the
3d Regiment Missouri Infantry, Army of the U. S., Alton, Illinois,
1863.</p>
<p class="hbookc">Rev. Jacob G. Forman (d. 1885), the compiler, was at the
time minister of the Unitarian Church at Alton. This little pocket
hymnal contains 99 hymns, and 26 additional patriotic songs.</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk32">32. <i>The Soldier&rsquo;s Hymn Book for Camp and Hospital</i>&mdash;Cambridge,
printed at the University Press, 1863.</p>
<p class="hbookc">There is no indication as to the source of this little book,
and the identity of its compiler has not been discovered. Its
contents, however, indicate that it came from a Unitarian source.
It is a pocket hymnal containing 150 familiar hymns and a few
prayers, somewhat larger and better printed than <a href="#hbk31">(31)</a>.</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk33">33. <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>&mdash;Boston, Ticknor &amp; Fields, 1864.</p>
<p class="hbookc">Edited by Samuel Longfellow (1819-1892) and Samuel Johnson
(1822-1882). This is the second and more famous hymn-book compiled by
the editors. It contains 717 hymns and represents their later and
more radical trend of thought, the book being theistic rather than
explicitly Christian in its emphasis. It introduced many hymns by
the editors themselves, and made drastic adaptations or revisions
of hymns by other authors. Like their first book <a href="#hbk24">(24)</a>, it was more
generally drawn upon as a source-book by later editors than it was
used in the churches. In that respect it was one of the most important
books in this series.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk34">34. <i>Hymn and Tune Book for the Church and Home</i>&mdash;Boston, 1868.</p>
<p class="hbookc">This book was compiled by a committee appointed by the
American Unitarian Association, but the editorial work was
chiefly done by Rev. Leonard J. Livermore (1822-1886). It is
the first hymn-book to be issued by the Association and the first
American Unitarian hymn-book to be completely furnished with tunes.
It contained 740 hymns, about 30 chants, etc., and 299 tunes, a
large proportion of which have since dropped out of use. Regarded
as in some measure an authorized denominational hymn-book, it had
wide use, though it &ldquo;marked no advance over its predecessors, but
its tunes were well up to the average level and gave it a great
advantage,&rdquo; and stimulated congregational singing.</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk35">35. <i>Hymns for the Christian Church, for the use of the First
Church of Christ in Boston</i>&mdash;Boston, 1869.</p>
<p class="hbookc">Edited by Rev. Rufus Ellis (1819-1885), minister of the First
Church, Boston. It was based on Lunt&rsquo;s conservative Christian Psalter <a href="#hbk15">(15)</a>
which had been in use in the First Church for 25 years. About 250
hymns were retained from the earlier volume and enough more added
to bring the total to 469. The selections were well made, but,
without music, the book could not compete with the more inclusive
<i>Hymn and Tune Book</i> <a href="#hbk34">(34)</a> which the American Unitarian Association
had published the preceding year.</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk36">36. <i>Hymn and Tune Book for the Church and Home</i>&mdash;Revised edition.
American Unitarian Association, Boston, 1877.</p>
<p class="hbookc">The compiler&rsquo;s name nowhere appears in the book, which was
edited by Rev. Rush R. Shippen (1828-1911), then Secretary of the
American Unitarian Association. It is a thorough-going revision of
<a href="#hbk34">(34)</a>, virtually a new book. It contains 871 hymns, 14 chants, etc.,
316 tunes, a much richer selection than its predecessor, although
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
the music was still of the mid-century type, with only a few
examples of the newer English tunes which were being introduced
into America by the choirs of Episcopal churches. The book was
well adapted to the general needs of Unitarians and was the most
widely used book among the Unitarian churches for the ensuing
forty years.</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk37">37. <i>Unity Hymns and Chorals</i>&mdash;Edited by W. C. Gannett, J. V. Blake,
F. L. Hosmer. Chicago, 1880.</p>
<p class="hbookc">A later and largely revised edition was published in 1911 by
Hosmer and Gannett. The editors, Frederick Lucian Hosmer (1840-1929),
William Channing Gannett (1840-1923), and James Vila Blake
(1842-1925), were hymn-writers and ministers in the Western Unitarian
Conference. This small book, noted for its &ldquo;split-leaf&rdquo;
arrangement, represented the point of view of the &ldquo;left-wing&rdquo; group
in the denomination. In its two editions it contained most of the
hymns by its editors, and a good many by other authors which appeared
for the first time within its covers. In this respect, as
in its radical character, it may be compared to the hymn-books by
Longfellow and Johnson (<a href="#hbk24">24</a> and <a href="#hbk33">33</a>). It was widely used in the
Western Unitarian Conference. Musically it was mediocre.</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk38">38. <i>Sacred Songs for Public Worship: A Hymn and Tune Book</i>&mdash;Edited
by M. J. Savage and Howard M. Dow. Boston, 1883.</p>
<p class="hbookc">This small book contains 195 hymns and songs for popular use,
selected by Minot J. Savage (1841-1918), minister of Unity Church,
Boston, Mass., and set to music by Howard M. Dow. Forty-two items are
from Mr. Savage&rsquo;s pen, the rest mostly from familiar sources. It
is much more of a &ldquo;one-man book&rdquo; and musically nearer akin to the
typical gospel song-book than any other collection in this series.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk39">39. <i>Hymns of the Church Universal</i>&mdash;Compiled by the Rev. Henry
Wilder Foote [I]: Revised and edited by Mary W. Tileston and
Arthur Foote. Boston, 1890.</p>
<p class="hbookc">This book was compiled for use in King&rsquo;s Chapel, Boston, of
which Mr. Foote (1838-1889) was minister, but was not published
until after his death, the editorial work being completed by his
sister and brother. The book superseded <i>Greenwood&rsquo;s Collection</i> <a href="#hbk13">(13)</a>
in King&rsquo;s Chapel, and had considerable use elsewhere. It contained
647 hymns, a number of chants, and 299 tunes. It introduced
many hymns and tunes of the later 19<sup>th</sup> century English
authors and composers which were not found in any earlier American
Unitarian collections, and was influential in setting a
standard for later books.</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk40">40. <i>Hymnal: Amore Dei</i>&mdash;Compiled by Mrs. Theodore C. Williams,
Boston, 1890. Revised, 1897.</p>
<p class="hbookc">Edited by Mrs. Williams in co-operation with her husband,
Rev. Theodore C. Williams (1855-1915), minister of All Souls&rsquo;
Church, New York.</p>
<p class="hbookc">It contained 382 hymns, about 25 chants and responses and
272 tunes. A collection similar to <i>Hymns of the Church Universal</i>
<a href="#hbk39">(39)</a> in utilizing the newer English hymns and tunes of the nineteenth
century, it had many excellencies and considerable use. The biographical
indexes of composers and authors are far more complete than
those of any earlier book in this series.</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk41">41. <i>Hymns for Church and Home</i>&mdash;American Unitarian Association,
Boston, 1895.</p>
<p class="hbookc">Edited by Mary Wilder Tileston and Arthur Foote, it was in
effect a revised and enlarged edition of <i>Hymns for the Church Universal</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
<a href="#hbk39">(39)</a>, containing 801 hymns. It was an admirable compilation
but rather large and heavy for handling.</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk42">42. <i>Hymns for Church and Home Abridged</i>&mdash;1902.</p>
<p class="hbookc">An edition of <a href="#hbk41">(41)</a> with the number of hymns reduced to 513.</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk43">43. <i>Hymns of the Ages</i>&mdash;Cambridge: The University Press. 1904.</p>
<p class="hbookc">Edited by Louisa Putnam Loring (1854-1924). A book of high
literary and musical standards, based upon the (Harvard) <i>University
Hymn Book</i> (1895). It contained 316 hymns and 205 tunes, but it
represented a rather limited and individualistic point of view and
did not prove adaptable to general use.</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk44">44. <i>Isles of Shoals Hymn Book and Candle Light Service</i>&mdash;The Isles
of Shoals Association, 1908.</p>
<p class="hbookc">Edited by Rev. George H. Badger (1859-1954). Since the book
was intended for use at the summer meetings on the Isles of Shoals,
off Portsmouth, N. H., the religious interpretation of nature is
strongly emphasized. The book contains 219 hymns and 96 tunes,
mostly selected from <i>Hymns for Church and Home</i> <a href="#hbk41">(41)</a>, but nine of
them are original contributions to this book, some with lines
referring directly to the island setting or history. Both words
and music represent the highest standards at the time of publication,
and the book is an exceptional collection of hymns expressing
this aspect of religion.</p>
<p class="hbook" id="hbk45">45. <i>The New Hymn and Tune Book</i>&mdash;American Unitarian Association:
Boston, 1914.</p>
<p class="hbookc">Edited by a commission: Rev. Samuel A. Eliot (1862-1950),
Chairman; Rev. Henry Wilder Foote, (II), (1875-____), Secretary;
Rev. Rush R. Shippen, (1828-1911), Rev. Lewis G. Wilson, (1858-1928).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p class="hbookc">Nominally a revision of the <i>Hymn and Tune Book</i> of 1877 <a href="#hbk36">(36)</a>,
it was in effect a new compilation, drawing largely upon <i>Hymns for
Church and Home</i> <a href="#hbk41">(41)</a>, <i>Amore Dei</i> <a href="#hbk40">(40)</a> and <i>Unity Hymns and Chorals</i>
<a href="#hbk37">(37)</a>. It contained 546 hymns, 28 chants, etc., and 268 tunes. It
also included a set of services and responsive readings, prepared

books and was more widely adopted than any of them. In its music
it was less progressive than in its selection of hymns, representing
the musical standard and practice of about 1900.</p>

<br /><span class="small">with Notes on Hymns</span></h2>
<div class="biography" id="Adams_JQ" title="Adams, Hon. John Quincy">
<p><b>Adams, Hon. John Quincy</b>, Braintree (now Quincy), Massachusetts,
July 11, 1767&mdash;February 21, 1848, Washington, D. C. He
graduated from Harvard in 1787. From 1794-1801 he was United
States Minister to England, the Netherlands and Prussia. In
1806 he was appointed Professor of Rhetoric at Harvard. In
1809 he became United States Minister to Russia, in 1817 he was
Secretary of State, and from 1824 to 1828 he was President of
the United States. In 1831 he was elected to the House of
Representatives, in which body he served until his death.</p>
<p>Most of his verse, both religious and secular, was written
after he had left the Presidency, but he remains the only hymn
writer who has ever been President of this country. In his
later years he composed a metrical version of the Psalms, best
described as a free rendering in fairly good verse of what he
felt was the essential idea of each Psalm. When his minister,
<a href="#Lunt_WP">Rev. William P. Lunt</a>, <i>q.v.</i>, of the First Parish, (Unitarian)
Quincy, Massachusetts, undertook the preparation of his hymn
book <i>The Christian Psalmist</i>, (1841), Mrs. Adams put the manuscript
of her husband&rsquo;s metrical Psalms into Mr. Lunt&rsquo;s hands,
and the latter included 17 of them in his book, and five other
hymns by his distinguished parishioner.</p>
<p>The effect on Adams is recorded in a moving entry in his
<i>Journal</i> which reveals an aspect of his character quite unknown
to those who regarded him as an opinionated and uncompromising
though sincere and upright politician. He wrote on June 29, 1845,
&ldquo;Mr. Lunt preached this morning, Eccles. III, 1. For everything
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
there is a season. He had given out as the first hymn to be
sung the 138<sup>th</sup> of the Christian Psalter, his compilation and
the hymn-book now used in our church. It was my version of
the 65<sup>th</sup> Psalm; and no words can express the sensations with
which I heard it sung. Were it possible to compress into one
pulsation of the heart the pleasure which, in the whole period
of my life, I have enjoyed in praise from the lips of mortal
man, it would not weigh a straw to balance the ecstasy of
delight which streamed from my eyes as the organ pealed and
the choir of voices sung the praise of Almighty God from the
soul of David, adapted to my native tongue by me.<span class="hst"> There</span>
was one drawback. In the printed book, the fifth line of the
second stanza reads,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;The morning&rsquo;s dawn, the evening&rsquo;s shade,&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>and so it was sung, but the corresponding seventh line of the
same stanza reads,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;The fields from thee the rains receive,&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>totally destroying the rhyme. I instantly saw that the fifth
line should read,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;The morning&rsquo;s dawn, the shades of eve,&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>but whether this enormous blunder was committed by the copyist
or the pressman I am left to conjecture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Adams&rsquo; death his verses, both religious and secular,
were published in a small volume entitled <i>Poems of Religion and
Society</i>, New York, 1848, which ran to a fourth edition in 1854.
This collection included the five hymns and 17 metrical Psalms
printed in <i>The Christian Psalmist</i>, unchanged except that the
opening line of each psalm has been substituted for the number
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
of the psalm as its heading. Nor was the misprint which Adams
lamented amended. Judged by the conventional standards of his
time Adams&rsquo; poetry was consistently respectable verse, but
without any notable distinction other than that lent to it by
the fame of the author.</p>
<p>His five hymns are,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. <i>Sure to the mansions of the blest</i>, <span class="hst">(Death of Children)</span></p>
<p>This is part of a piece of 20 stanzas, which appeared
in the <i>Monthly Anthology and Boston Review</i>, January 1807.
It is entitled &ldquo;Lines addressed to a mother on the death
of two infants, 19th Sept. 1803, and 19th Decb. 1806.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2. <i>Alas! how swift the moments fly</i>, <span class="hst">(The Hour-Glass)</span></p>
<p>Sometimes given as</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t"><i>How swift, alas, the moments fly</i>,</p>
</div>
<p>written for the 200<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the First Parish
Church in Quincy, September 20, 1839.</p>
<p>3. <i>Hark! &rsquo;tis the holy temple bell</i>, <span class="hst">(Sabbath morning) undated</span></p>
<p>4. <i>When, o&rsquo;er the billow-heaving deep</i>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Hymn for the twenty-second of December,&rdquo; i.e., the
coming of the Pilgrim Fathers, undated.</p>
<p>5. <i>Lord of all worlds, let thanks and praise</i>,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Written in Sickness;&rdquo; undated.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>His metrical versions of the Psalms follow:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>6. <i>Blest is the mortal whose delight</i>, Ps. 1</p>
<p>7. <i>Come let us sing unto the Lord</i>, Ps. 95</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>8. <i>For thee in Zion there is praise</i>, Ps. 65</p>
<p>9. <i>My Shepherd is the Lord on high</i>, Ps. 23</p>
<p>10. <i>My soul, before thy Maker kneel</i>, Ps. 103</p>
<p>11. <i>O, all ye people, clap your hands</i>, Ps. 47</p>
<p>12. <i>O God, with goodness all thine own</i>, Ps. 67</p>
<p>13. <i>O heal me, Lord, for I am weak</i>, Ps. 6</p>
<p>14. <i>O, judge me, Lord, for thou art just</i>, Ps. 26</p>
<p>15. <i>O Lord my God! how great thou art</i>, Ps. 104</p>
<p>16. <i>O Lord, thy all-discerning eyes</i>, Ps. 139</p>
<p>17. <i>O that the race of men would raise</i>, Ps. 107</p>
<p>18. <i>Send forth, O God, thy truth and light</i>, Ps. 43</p>
<p>19. <i>Sing to Jehovah a new song</i>, Ps. 98</p>
<p>20. <i>Sing to the Lord a song of praise</i>, Ps. 149</p>
<p>21. <i>Turn to the stars of heaven thine eyes</i>, Ps. 19</p>
<p>22. <i>Why should I fear in evil days</i>, Ps. 49</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few of these hymns and psalms found their way into other
collections. Nos. 2 and 3 were included in <i>Lyra Sacra Americana</i>;
no. 18 is in <i>Hymnal for American Youth</i> and the <i>American
Student Hymnal</i>; no. 16 is in the Jewish <i>Union Hymnal for
Worship</i>, 1914.</p>

He graduated from the Harvard Divinity School in 1847 and in

Roxbury, Massachusetts. In 1855 he was settled over the
Bulfinch Place Church, Boston. He was a popular lecturer

<p>Other poems by him, including a hymn for the graduation
of his class from the Divinity School in 1847 and another

missionary in Minnesota. In 1859 he joined the Unitarian
denomination and served several churches, his last pastorate
being with the Church of the Disciples, Boston. In 1905 he

<p>In Hedge and Huntington&rsquo;s <i>Hymns for the Church of

First Lines the name of the author, (often only his or her surname)
is given in most instances. The Index also lists 57 hymns
as &ldquo;Anon.&rdquo; or, more often, with no word as to authorship. The
source of several of these hymns can be traced in Julian&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary</i>

<p><i>Come, Holy Spirit, hush my heart</i>,</p>
<p>C.M. <span class="hst">3 stas.</span> <span class="hst">3 <i>Isles of Shoals Hymn Book</i>, 1908.</span></p>
<p><i>Come thou Almighty King!</i></p>
<p>The widely used hymn to the Trinity which begins with
this line was written about 1757 in England. It has
often been mistakenly attributed to Charles Wesley, and
research has failed to discover who its author was.
Perhaps he thought it prudent not to disclose his name
because both his words and the tune by Felice di Giardini
to which it was set in 1769 offered so marked a contrast
to the British national anthem, in the same unusual metre,
which had come into popular use about 1745 with the words
<i>God save our lord the King</i>. American Unitarians in the
19<sup>th</sup> century could sing the first stanza of the hymn,
addressed to the &ldquo;Father all glorious,&rdquo; but not the trinitarian
stanzas which followed. An unknown writer produced
two additional stanzas in a carefully revised version which
was included in Lunt&rsquo;s <i>Christian Psalter</i>, 1841; in the 1851
<i>Supplement</i> to Longfellow and Johnson&rsquo;s <i>Book of Hymns</i>, 1846;
and in their <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>, 1864. This version, however,
was not satisfactory to later Unitarians and was again
largely rewritten in the form in which it has been included
in most of the Unitarian hymn books of more recent date.
This version will be found in <i>The New Hymn and Tune Book</i>,
1914, and in <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>, 1937.</p>

Arlington Street Church) Boston, which he served until his death.
Harvard gave him the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity in
1792. He was the author of a three volume <i>History of New Hampshire</i>;
of a petition (1788) for the abolition of the slave trade;
and of other books and essays; and formed the plan for the Massachusetts
Historical Society, organized in 1791. He wrote no hymns
but made an important contribution to American hymnody in his
collection <i>Sacred Poetry: consisting of Psalms and Hymns adapted
to Christian devotion in public and private. Selected from the
best authors, with variations and additions</i>, by Jeremy Belknap,
D.D., Boston, 1795, which ran to many editions. His intention
was to provide a book acceptable to both the conservative and the
liberal wings of Congregationalism, to bridge the widening gap
which resulted in the formation of the Unitarian denomination a
generation later. In this he failed, for only the liberal
churches accepted it, though it was widely used by them for 40
years, being much the best of the period. It includes 300 hymns
from the best English sources, and was the first to introduce to
Americans the hymns by Anne Steele. The only American hymns in

practised until 1825 when he removed to New York. There he devoted
himself to journalism as editor of <i>The New York Review</i> and of the

<p>Dated 1836, but Beard, in his <i>Collection</i>, (British)
1837, gives it as an original contribution, thus
fixing the date of first publication. Putnam, <i>Singers
and Songs</i>, etc., notes that it was &ldquo;Written, probably,
for some church in England,&rdquo; information which sounds
like the aged poet&rsquo;s vague recollection many years after
he had responded to Beard&rsquo;s request. Included in Lunt&rsquo;s
<i>Christian Psalter</i>, 1841.</p>

afterwards destroyed by fire. This hymn is the most
widely used of all those written by Bryant. It was
included in Beard&rsquo;s English <i>Collection</i> in 1837, and in
Martineau&rsquo;s <i>Hymns</i>, 1873. In Putnam&rsquo;s <i>Singers and Songs</i>,

<p>This is one of Bryant&rsquo;s best known poems, entitled

a hymn, although included in Martineau&rsquo;s <i>Hymns</i>, 1873.</p>
<p>26.  <i>Wild was the day, the wintry sea</i>, <span class="hst">(The Pilgrim Fathers)</span></p>
<p>Included in Longfellow and Johnson&rsquo;s <i>Hymns of the
Spirit</i>, 1864.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Putnam, <i>Singers and Songs</i>, etc., p. 123 reports a hymn beginning</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Ancient of Days! except Thou deign</i>,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;written for the dedication of Rev. R. C. Waterston&rsquo;s church in
Boston,&rdquo; and another hymn beginning</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Lord, from whose glorious presence came</i>,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>written &ldquo;at the request of a friend, Mr. Hiram Barney, for the opening
of an Orthodox Congregational Church,&rdquo; but does not print the
text of either, and neither appears to have been included in any
Collection.</p>
<p>As indicated in the foregoing list, the text of several of
Bryant&rsquo;s hymns is found with the opening line altered from the
original, either by the author himself, or, presumably, with his
consent, so that it is impossible to say which is the correct or
authorized form, and frequently no more than approximate date of
composition can be given.</p>
<p>The early flowering of Bryant&rsquo;s gifts as a poet, promoted by
a fortunate combination of circumstances, quickly brought him widespread
recognition in both Great Britain and America, which deepened
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
into respect for his fine character as he advanced in age. The
writings of no other American poet of his period were so eagerly
searched by compilers of hymn books, who sometimes included verses
which were meditative, poems rather than hymns, e.g., nos. 8, 10,
20 and 25 in the above list. Bryant&rsquo;s mind was cool and meditative,
and his hymns are correct and smoothly flowing, but seldom touched
with lyric fire, and none of them quite reach the highest level.
They express an attitude towards religion characteristic of the
intellectual life of his time but now largely passed away. No. 16
is still included in several leading hymn collections of the 20<sup>th</sup>
century; nos. 11 and 18 are in the Unitarian <i>New Hymn and Tune
Book</i>, 1914; and nos. 12 and 18 are in <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>, 1937.</p>

<p><b>Bulfinch, Rev. Stephen Greenleaf, D.D.</b>, Boston, Massachusetts,
June 18, 1809&mdash;October 12, 1870, Cambridge, Massachusetts.
He was son of Charles Bulfinch, a leading architect, and received
his early education in Washington, D.C., returning to Cambridge
to enter the Harvard Divinity School, from which he graduated in
1830. He was ordained in January, 1831, as assistant to
<a href="#Gilman_S">Rev. Samuel Gilman</a>, <i>q.v.</i>, of Charleston, South Carolina, and later
served Unitarian churches in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Washington,
D.C.; Nashua, New Hampshire; Dorchester, Massachusetts and East
Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was a voluminous writer in both
prose and verse. Most of his hymns first appeared in his books
<i>Contemplations of the Saviour</i>, Boston, 1832; <i>Poems</i>, Charleston,
1834; and <i>Lays of the Gospel</i>, 1845. The first of these was reprinted
in England, where 19 of his hymns were included in Beard&rsquo;s
<i>Collection</i>, 1837, and where they had widespread use.</p>
<p>His best known hymns are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl class="undent"><dt>1. <i>Benignant Saviour: &rsquo;twas not thine</i>, <span class="hst">(Compassion of Christ)</span></dt></dl>
<p>From his &ldquo;Contemplations of the Saviour,&rdquo; altered

<p>These hymns are well written contemplations of gospel episodes,
as viewed by the conservative piety of the author&rsquo;s period.
Several were included in Longfellow and Johnson&rsquo;s <i>Book of Hymns</i>,
1846-1848; nos. 6 and 10 are in Hedge and Huntington&rsquo;s <i>Hymns
for the Church of Christ</i>, 1853; and most of them in one and another
19<sup>th</sup> century collection. Only No. 4 has survived in present-day
use, being found in <i>The New Hymn and Tune Book</i>, 1914, and <i>Hymns

<div class="biography" id="Burleigh_WH" title="Burleigh, William Henry">
<p><b>Burleigh, William Henry</b>, Woodstock, Connecticut, February 12,
1812&mdash;March 18, 1871, Brooklyn, New York. He was an editor
and publisher working successively in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
1837-1843; in Hartford, Connecticut, 1843-1849; in Syracuse, New
York, 1849-1854. From 1855-1870 he was Harbor Master of New
York. He was a member of the Second Unitarian Church in Brooklyn
and an ardent advocate of anti-slavery and temperance reforms.
Early in life he began writing hymns and other poems which were
printed in various periodicals, but for many of which the date
and occasion are impossible to determine. They were collected
for publication in a volume entitled <i>Poems</i>, Philadelphia, 1841,
and this book, enlarged with his later poems, was republished in
1871 after his death, with a biographical notice by his wife.
Some of the best were included in the British collection <i>Lyra
Sacra Americana</i>, 1868, the editor of which, Dr. Cleveland, said,
&ldquo;Most of these beautiful hymns of Mr. Burleigh&rsquo;s were given to
me in ms. by the author.&rdquo; From this publication they were taken
for extensive use in British hymn books.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. <i>Abide not in the realm of dreams</i>, <span class="hst">(The Harvest Call)</span></p>
<p>Included in Putnam, <i>Singers and Songs</i>, etc., is
a poem of 10 stanzas from which a cento consisting of
the first two lines of stanza 1 combined with the
second two lines of stanza 2, followed by stanzas
3, 6, 7 and 10 are taken to form a hymn in the <i>New
Hymn and Tune Book</i>, 1914, and in <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>,
1937.</p>

the first edition of <i>Poems</i>, 1841, stanzas selected
from it came into use as early as 1844. The original
is in 5 stanzas of 8 lines. From it the following
centos have come into use.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">(a) <i>Day unto day uttereth speech</i>,</p>
</div>
<p>This consists of stanzas III-V, and is
given in the <i>Christian Hymns</i> of the Cheshire

<p><b>Chadwick, Rev. John White</b>, Marblehead, Massachusetts,
October 19, 1840&mdash;December 11, 1904, Brooklyn, New York.
After two years of study at the Bridgewater Normal School, and
a shorter period at Phillips Exeter Academy, he entered the
Harvard Divinity School, from which he graduated in 1864. He
received the degree of A.M. 1888. In December, 1864, he was
ordained minister of the Second Unitarian Church, Brooklyn,
where he remained until his death. He was an influential
preacher and a prolific author in both prose and verse, his
principal publications being a <i>Book of Poems</i>, 1876, <i>Nazareth
Town</i>, 1883 (poems), the two being later combined and republished
in 1888 with the earlier title; <i>The Bible Today</i>, 1879: <i>Old and New
Unitarian Belief</i>, 1894; and first-rate biographies of <i>Theodore
Parker</i>, 1901, and <i>William Ellery Channing</i>, 1903. After his death
a small volume was published entitled <i>Later Poems</i>, 1905, and his
printed sermons have been collected in 14 volumes. As a young man
he became a close friend of <a href="#Gannett_WC">W. C. Gannett</a>, <i>q.v.</i>, and <a href="#Gannett_WC">F. L. Hosmer</a>,
<i>q.v.</i>, both of whom were also born in 1840, though not his classmates
in the Divinity School, and his hymns are expressions of a
theological outlook similar to theirs, notably in his endeavor to
give a religious interpretation to the then disputed doctrine of
evolution. Although several of his hymns are of exceptionally
fine quality, he often wrote in haste, lacking the patience with
which his two friends sought for the precise word to convey their
meaning, but he often abbreviated or re-wrote his verses at the
request of hymn-book editors, or willingly accepted their proposed
alterations. The result is that some of his hymns now appear in
forms which depart considerably from their original texts. His
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
secular poems, mostly the utterances of a nature lover, are often
the too hastily written verse of a minor poet.</p>
<p>His <i>Book of Poems</i>, 1888, and <i>Later Poems</i>, 1905, include
all his hymns, three of which had little use, viz:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. <i>A gentle tumult in the earth</i>, <span class="hst">(Easter) 1876</span></p>
<p>2. <i>Everlasting Holy One</i>, <span class="hst">(Invocation) 1875</span></p>
<p>3. <i>O God, we come not as of old</i>, <span class="hst">(Worship) 1874</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>His best known hymn was written for the Visitation Day exercises
at the Harvard Divinity School, 1864,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4. <i>Eternal Ruler of the ceaseless round</i>,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has been widely used in Great Britain and in this country.
Other hymns by him have had considerable use, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5. <i>Another year of setting suns</i>, <span class="hst">(New Year&rsquo;s) 1873</span></p>
<p>This was written in ten stanzas beginning</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">&ldquo;That this shall be a better year,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>but in <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>, 1937, only stas. 5, 6, 7, and 10
are given, beginning as above.</p>
<p>6. <i>It singeth low in every heart</i>, <span class="hst">(Commemoration) 1876</span></p>
<p>Written for the 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the dedication of
his church in Brooklyn, and widely used.</p>
<p>7. <i>Now sing we a song of the harvest</i>, <span class="hst">(Thanksgiving Day) 1871</span></p>
<p>8. <i>O Love Divine, of all that is</i>, <span class="hst">(A song of Trust) 1865</span></p>
<p>9. <i>O Thou, whose perfect goodness crowns</i>, <span class="hst">(Anniversary Hymn)</span></p>
<p>Written in 1889 for the 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary of his ordination.</p>
<p>10. <i>Thou glorious God, before whose face</i>, <span class="hst">(Anniversary Hymn)</span></p>
<p>Undated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>

<p>Several of the above hymns, as printed in current
hymn-books, consist of selected stanzas, or have been slightly
altered from their original forms, in most cases by Gannett and
Hosmer, for inclusion in their collection <i>Unity Hymns and Chorals</i>,
1880, 1911. Two others included in <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>, 1937,
were not written as hymns but have been quarried out of verses
in <i>Later Poems</i>, by permission of the author&rsquo;s widow, viz:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>14. <i>Spirit of God, in thunder speak</i>, <span class="hst">(Summons to Duty)</span></p>
<p>This arrangement combines stanzas 13 and 16 in the poem
entitled &ldquo;A Missionary Chant&rdquo;, used as the first two
stanzas of the hymn, with stanzas 8 and 9 of the poem
to &ldquo;William Cullen Bryant&rdquo; as the third and fourth
stanzas of the hymn, both poems being found in <i>Later
Poems</i>, 1905.</p>
<p>15. <i>Thou mighty God, who didst of old</i>, <span class="hst">(Communion of Saints)</span></p>
<p>This is arranged from the same sources. Stanzas 1 and
2 are the first two stanzas in &ldquo;William Cullen Bryant,&rdquo;
the last three stanzas are stanzas 11, 7, and 8 in
&ldquo;A Missionary Chant,&rdquo; considerably altered. These arrangements
were made by H. W. Foote, with the co&ouml;peration of

<div class="biography" id="Clarke_JF" title="Clarke, Rev. James Freeman, D.D.">
<p><b>Clarke, Rev. James Freeman, D.D.</b>, Hanover, New Hampshire,
April 4, 1810&mdash;June 8, 1888, Boston, Massachusetts. He was
named for his step-grandfather, <a href="#Freeman_J">Rev. James Freeman</a>, <i>q.v.</i> He
graduated from Harvard College in 1829 and from the Harvard
Divinity School in 1833. He served as minister of the Unitarian
Church in Louisville, Kentucky, from 1833 to 1840. In 1841 he
returned to Boston where he gathered a group of persons interested
in the more radical social and religious reforms of the day into
a church which he named the Church of the Disciples (Unitarian) of
which he remained minister until his death. He became one of the
most distinguished ministers of his period in Boston, greatly
beloved and admired for his courage as well as his piety, his
wisdom as well as his wit. He was the author of several books
(and many short printed articles) the best known of which were
his <i>Orthodoxy: its Truths and Errors</i>, and <i>Ten Great Religions</i>.
The latter is an amplification of lectures on Comparative Religion
which he gave at the Harvard Divinity School as early as 1854, and
again for several years in the eighteen-seventies, the earliest course
in this field of study to be given in any American theological school.
In 1844 he published a <i>Service Book</i> for use by his congregation,
which included a small selection of hymns, among them Sarah Flower
Adams&rsquo; <i>Nearer my, God, to Thee</i>, which had appeared in England only
three years earlier and was now introduced for the first time to
an American congregation, whence it quickly passed into numerous
other collections. In 1852 a revised and enlarged edition of the
<i>Service Book</i> was published entitled the <i>Disciples Hymn Book</i>, which
included five hymns by the compiler. A few of his poems are included
in Putnam&rsquo;s <i>Singers and Songs of the Liberal Faith</i>, and the
following hymns by him have come into some use.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>1. <i>Brother, hast thou wandered far?</i>  <span class="hst">(The Prodigal)</span></p>
<p>First printed in the <i>Service Book</i>, 1844. It
appeared in abbreviated form as</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t"><i>Hast thou wasted all the powers?</i></p>
</div>
<p>(beginning with the second stanza) in <i>Hymns for the
Church of Christ</i>, 1853; in Beecher&rsquo;s <i>Plymouth Collection</i>,
1855, and in other American and British
books.</p>
<p>2. <i>Dear Friend, whose presence in the house</i>, <span class="hst">(Jesus at Cana)</span></p>
<p>Dated 1855. A tender poem rather than a hymn,
included in the British <i>Lyra Sacra Americana</i>.</p>
<p>3. <i>Father, to us Thy children humbly kneeling</i> <span class="hst">(Aspiration)</span></p>
<p>About 1833, after arrival in Louisville, Clarke wrote
a poem entitled &ldquo;Hymn and Prayer&rdquo; beginning <i>Infinite
Spirit, who art round us ever</i>, which was published in
<i>The Dial</i> for January, 1841. Five stanzas beginning</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t"><i>Unseen, yet not unfelt!&mdash;if any thought</i></p>
</div>
<p>were taken from this form of the poem for inclusion
in Hedge and Huntington&rsquo;s <i>Hymns for the Church of
Christ</i>, 1853, but already Clarke had taken from his
poem, and largely rewritten, three stanzas to make
the hymn beginning as above. In this later form it
was included in his <i>Service Book</i>, 1844, in Longfellow
and Johnson&rsquo;s <i>Book of Hymns</i>, 1846, in the <i>Disciples
Hymn Book</i>, 1852, and in many later collections down
to the present day.</p>
<p>4. <i>For all thy gifts we bless Thee, Lord</i></p>
<p>Written for a Unitarian Convention in New York City,
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
held on October 22, 1845, and included in <i>Hymns for
the Church of Christ</i>, 1853.</p>
<p>5. <i>Hast thou wasted all the powers</i>,</p>
<p>Included in <i>Hymns for the Church of Christ</i>, 1853.</p>
<p>6. <i>To him who children blessed</i> <span class="hst">(Christening)</span></p>
<p>7. <i>To Thee, O God in heaven</i> <span class="hst">(Christening)</span></p>
<p>Both of these tender and beautiful hymns for a christening
appeared in the <i>Service Book</i>, 1844, and have passed
into a good many other collections, although hymns are
now seldom sung at such a service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the above no. 3 was included in Longfellow and Johnson&rsquo;s
<i>Book of Hymns</i>, 1846, attributed to Clarke, and nos. 1, 5 and 6
were included as Anonymous. In their <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>, 1864,
these hymns were correctly attributed to Clarke. He was the author
of a limited quantity of pleasing religious verse acceptable to his
many friends rather than a hymn writer of distinction, his best ones
being nos. 3, 5 and 6. <i>The New Hymn and Tune Book</i>, 1914, includes
nos. 3 and 6; <i>The Pilgrim Hymnal</i>, 1935, includes nos. 3 and 5;

manhood he became a blacksmith, which had been his father&rsquo;s
trade. He joined the Methodist Church in 1847 and three

Pennsylvania, where he was both a blacksmith and a preacher.

natural gifts as a preacher brought him an invitation in
1859 to go to Chicago to take charge of the newly organized
Unity Church in that city, which he served until 1879, when
he accepted a call to the Church of the Messiah (Unitarian),
New York. He was a widely popular lecturer and author of
many published sermons, other articles, and a few occasional
verses. The church of which he was minister was destroyed by
the great Chicago fire of 1870 but was soon rebuilt. For the

<p><b>Emerson, Ralph Waldo, LL.D.</b>, Boston, Massachusetts, May 25, 1803&mdash;April
27, 1882, Concord, Massachusetts. He was the son of
<a href="#hbk5">Rev. William Emerson</a>, <i>q.v.</i>, minister of the First Church of Boston
(Unitarian) who, though not himself a hymn writer, published
in 1808 the excellent small collection entitled <i>A Collection of
Psalms and Hymns</i> <a href="#hbk5">(5)</a>.</p>
<p>R. W. Emerson graduated from Harvard College in 1821 and after
further study in the Harvard Divinity School took his A.M. in 1827.
He was ordained in 1829 as minister of the Second Church of Boston
(Unitarian). He served the church for three years but resigned
in 1832, feeling that his pastoral work was inadequate and that
he was not in accord with his parishioners&rsquo; views about the Communion
Service. A volume of his sermons, selected and edited by A. C.
McGiffert, Jr., was published in 1938 under the title <i>The Young Emerson
Speaks</i>. Although he preached occasionally for several years thereafter
he never held another pastorate, but retired to Concord and
devoted himself to lecturing and authorship. As an essayist and
poet he rose to great and lasting distinction. He published <i>Orations,
Lectures, and Addresses</i>, 1844; <i>Poems</i>, 1846; <i>Representative Men</i>, 1850;
<i>English Traits</i>, 1856; and a succession of later volumes. His <i>Collected
Works</i> were published after his death, in 12 volumes. Perhaps his most
famous essay was his epoch-making <i>Divinity School Address</i>, delivered
in 1838. In 1833 he wrote his hymn</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>We love the venerable house</i> <span class="hst">(The house of God)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>for the ordination of his successor, <a href="#Robbins_C">Rev. Chandler Robbins</a>, <i>q.v.</i>,
in the Second Church, though it is more a commemorative poem than an
ordination hymn. It was included in Longfellow and Johnson&rsquo;s <i>Hymns
of the Spirit</i>, 1864; in Martineau&rsquo;s <i>Hymns of Praise and Prayer</i>,
printed in England in 1873; and in later Unitarian and other hymn
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
books down to the present day. Four stanzas selected from this
poem, beginning with the second,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Here holy thoughts a light have shed</i>,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>were included in Hedge and Huntington&rsquo;s <i>Hymns for the Church of
Christ</i>, 1853, though without the author&rsquo;s name, and the same collection
erroneously attributed to Emerson a hymn beginning,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>All before us is the way</i>,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the author of which was <a href="#Clapp_ET">Eliza T. Clapp</a>, <i>q.v.</i>, an error which was
repeated in various other collections.</p>
<p>Part of Emerson&rsquo;s poem entitled <i>The Problem</i>, beginning</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Out of the heart of nature rolled</i> <span class="hst">(The Everlasting Word)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>originally printed in the <i>Dial</i>, July, 1840, and then in his <i>Poems</i>,
1846, was also included in <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>, 1864, and in
Martineau&rsquo;s <i>Hymns</i>, but has since dropped out of use.</p>
<p>Another poem of two stanzas beginning</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Not gold, but only men can make</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>was attributed to Emerson in the later book called <i>Hymns of the
Spirit</i>, 1937, probably mistakenly. These verses are listed as
Emerson&rsquo;s in Granger&rsquo;s <i>Index to Poetry and Recitations</i>, under <i>A
Nation&rsquo;s Strength</i>, and Granger states that they are to be found
in a publication of The Penn Publishing Company of Philadelphia.
They are not to be found, however, in the <i>Centenary Edition of
Emerson&rsquo;s Poems</i> nor in Hubbell&rsquo;s <i>Concordance to the poems of
Emerson</i> (N. Y., Wilson, 1932).
It is therefore doubtful whether the attribution to Emerson is well-founded.</p>

of the New Jerusalem in Boston. He did some travelling on
behalf of this body, as far west as Wisconsin, in intervals
of employment at the Custom House and, later, at the Post Office
in Boston. He was author of books and essays, most of them expositions
of Swedenborgian doctrine, and of a small amount of occasional
verse, published in the periodicals of the day but never
collected in a printed volume. In his private collection of his
poems are a few hymns, only two of which appear to have had any
public use. One beginning</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Great Source of being, truth and love</i>,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>was written for the ordination of Rev. Thomas C. Adam as pastor
of the West Universalist Society in Boston, March 12, 1845. The
other,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>When Israel, humbled of the Lord</i>,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a protest against slavery published in the <i>Boston Journal</i>, in
July, 1861, was included, in part and considerably re-written,
in <i>The Soldier&rsquo;s Companion: Dedicated to the Defenders of their
Country in the Field, by their Friends at Home</i>. This was published
as the Army Number of the <i>Monthly Journal</i>, Boston, October,
1861, vol. II, no. 10, a small Unitarian collection of hymns and
devotional readings. In this collection the hymn begins,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>When Israel&rsquo;s foes, a numerous host</i>,</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>and is attributed to &ldquo;Rev. W. M. Fernald,&rdquo; though it is not
included in this form in the author&rsquo;s private collection of
his verse. None of his hymns appear to have had any further
use.</p>

1802, and was ordained an orthodox Congregational minister
at East Bridgewater in 1806, where he soon adopted more liberal
beliefs, and carried most of his congregation with him. In 1821
he accepted a call to the East Church (Unitarian) Salem, Massachusetts,
where he served until his death. In 1843 he published
<i>A Collection of Hymns for the Christian Church and Home</i>, to
replace the <a href="#hbk2">earlier collection (1788) by Rev. William Bentley</a>,

several hymns by himself. One of them, &ldquo;On leaving an old house
of worship,&rdquo; beginning</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Here to the high and holy One</i></p>

<p><b>Follen, Mrs. Eliza Lee</b> (<b>Cabot</b>), Boston, Massachusetts, August 15,
1787&mdash;January 26, 1860, Brookline, Massachusetts. In 1828 she
married Dr. Charles Follen, a German scholar who had sought
freedom in this country and who was then teaching German Literature
and Ecclesiastical History at Harvard. Later he was
minister of the Unitarian Church (now called the Follen Church
Society) at East Lexington, Massachusetts. Mrs. Follen both
before and after her marriage contributed verse and prose articles
to various periodicals and published a number of small books,
including <i>Hymns for Children</i>, Boston, 1825; <i>Poems</i>, 1839, and,
while she was in England in 1854, another small volume for
children, entitled <i>The Lark and the Linnet</i>. These books contain
some translations from the German and the versions of a few
Psalms.</p>
<p>Her best known hymns are</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. <i>How sweet to be allowed to pray</i>, <span class="hst">(Resignation)</span></p>
<p>This first appeared in <i>The Christian Disciple</i>,
September 1818, then in her <i>Poems</i>, 1839, entitled
&ldquo;Thy will be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2. <i>How sweet upon this sacred day</i> <span class="hst">(Sunday)</span></p>
<p>In <i>The Christian Disciple</i>, September, 1828, and in

<i>Hymns for Christian Devotion</i>, Boston, 1845; in Hedge

<i>Poems</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>4. <i>God, thou art good, each perfumed flower</i>, <span class="hst">(God In Nature)</span></p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t">(a) <i>God is good! each perfumed flower</i></p>
</div>
<p>and altered as above in her <i>Poems</i> and in <i>The
Lark and the Linnet</i>.</p>
<p>This hymn underwent further transformations in
England. In Emily Taylor&rsquo;s <i>Sabbath Recreations</i>,
1826, it was included as an original piece never
before printed, and signed &ldquo;E.L.C.&rdquo;, the initials
of Mrs. Follen&rsquo;s maiden name. Possibly she sent
a ms. copy to Miss Taylor before it appeared in
Boston. In J. R. Beard&rsquo;s British Unitarian <i>Collection
of Hymns</i>, 1837, it appears as</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">(b) <i>Yes, God is good! each perfumed flower</i>,</p>
</div>
<p>J. H. Gurney, the Anglican hymn writer and editor,
included it in his Lutterworth <i>Collection of Hymns
for Public Worship</i>, 1838, but, while retaining Mrs.
Follen&rsquo;s opening stanza, rewrote about half of the
remaining four stanzas, and in his later <i>Marylebone
Collection</i>, 1851, rewrote it further, beginning it</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">(c) <i>Yes, God is Good.&mdash;in earth and sky,</i></p>
</div>
<p>and in a note appended to the Index of first lines
he wrote that he had found the hymn &ldquo;in a small
American volume &mdash;&mdash; well conceived, but very imperfectly
executed,&rdquo; and that because of &ldquo;successive
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
alterations&mdash;the writer has not scrupled to put
his name to it, J.H.G.&rdquo; In these altered forms
the hymn had considerable use in England (For further
details see Julian, <i>Dictionary</i>, 1298).</p>
<p>5. <i>Will God, who made the earth and sea</i>, <span class="hst">(Child&rsquo;s Prayer)</span></p>
<p>In <i>Poems</i>, 1839. In Dr. Allan&rsquo;s (English) <i>Children&rsquo;s

(vol. I, 1882, vol. II, 1896, completed by others) gives an
authoritative account of the religious controversies in Colonial
Boston. At the time of his death he had in preparation a hymnbook
to replace the <a href="#hbk13"><i>Collection of Psalms and Hymns</i></a> which his
predecessor, Rev. F. W. P. Greenwood, <i>q.v.</i>, had published in
1830. His hymnbook was completed by his widow, his sister
<a href="#hbk41">Mrs. Mary W. Tileston</a>, (<i>q.v.</i>) and his brother Arthur Foote, and
was published in 1891 as <i>Hymns of the Church Universal</i>. It was
notable for its scholarly catholicity and helped to introduce
to American congregations the then popular English hymn tunes
of the &ldquo;cathedral school&rdquo; by Barnby, Dykes, Stainer, Sullivan

<p><b>Freeman, James</b>, D.D., Charlestown, Massachusetts, April 22, 1759&mdash;November
14, 1835, Boston, Massachusetts. He graduated from
Harvard College in 1777. In March, 1776, Rev. Henry Caner, rector
of King&rsquo;s Chapel, Boston, left with the British troops when they
evacuated the town, accompanied by many of his leading parishioners.
The remaining members of the church in September, 1782,
engaged James Freeman as a lay &ldquo;Reader&rdquo; to conduct worship. The
prayers for the King and royal family of England had been dropped
and Freemen soon began to omit references to the Trinity, expecting
soon to be dismissed as Reader. Instead the congregation
voted to revise the liturgy in accordance with his beliefs and
in 1785 published the first edition of the &ldquo;Book of Common Prayer
according to the Use of King&rsquo;s Chapel.&rdquo; This action led Bishop
Seabury, after his arrival in America, to refuse ordination to
Freeman, whereupon the congregation ordained him according to
Congregational usage. Freeman thus became &ldquo;the first avowed
preacher of Unitarianism in the United States.&rdquo; He remained
active pastor of the Chapel until 1826. He edited a <i>Collection
of Psalms and Hymns for public worship</i>, published in 1799. It
included 155 psalms &ldquo;selected chiefly from Tate and Brady,&rdquo;
followed by 90 hymns, and remained in use in the Chapel until
the publication in 1830 of the much better
<a href="#hbk13"><i>Collection</i> edited by his successor, Rev. F. W. P. Greenwood</a>, <i>q.v.</i>

<p>Dr. Furness&rsquo;s hymns, though creditable religious verse of
the period and widely esteemed because of the author&rsquo;s distinction,
nowhere attain a very high level of poetic beauty, and
almost all of them have passed out of use. Only nos. 8, 10,
and 12 were included in the Unitarian <i>New Hymn and Tune Book</i>,
1914, and only no. 12 survives in <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>, 1937.</p>

<p><b>Gannett, Rev. William Channing</b>, D.D., Boston, Massachusetts,
March 13, 1840&mdash;December 15, 1923, Rochester, New York. He
graduated from Harvard College in 1860; taught school in
Newport, Rhode Island one year; and spent four years on St.
Helena Island, South Carolina, as agent for the New England
Freedmen&rsquo;s Society doing relief and educational work with the
thousands of Negro refugees gathered there. In 1865 he studied
for a year in Europe, then entered the Harvard Divinity School
from which he graduated in 1868. His first pastorate was in
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 1868-1871. He then spent several years
writing a biography of his father, Ezra Stiles Gannett, who had
been William Ellery Channing&rsquo;s successor as minister of the
Federal Street Church, Boston. He was minister of Unity Church
in St. Paul, Minnesota, 1877-1883; served the Western Unitarian
Conference for four years; was minister at Hinsdale, Illinois,
1887-1889; and of the Unitarian Church in Rochester, New York,
1889-1908, where he remained as minister-emeritus until his
death. Throughout his professional career he was closely associated
with Frederick Lucian Hosmer, <i>q.v.</i> Together they published
three small collections entitled <i>The Thought of God in
Hymns and Poems</i>, the first in 1885, the second in 1894, the
third in 1918; and together they also edited <i>Unity Hymns and
Chorals</i>, 1880, revised edition in 1911. <a href="#Blake_JV">James Vila Blake</a>, <i>q.v.</i>,
was co-editor of the first edition. This little hymn book is
a markedly individualistic production with many of the older
hymns altered to conform to the beliefs of the editors.</p>
<p>In these publications, in which most of their own hymns were
first published, and in the careful workmanship with which their
thought was brought to a perfection of poetic utterance, Gannett
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
and Hosmer may be compared to Samuel Longfellow and
Samuel Johnson whose <i>Book of Hymns</i>, 1846, and <i>Hymns of the
Spirit</i>, 1864, had appeared a generation earlier.</p>
<p>Dr. Gannett&rsquo;s hymns are listed, with annotations &ldquo;based
upon ms. notes kindly supplied by the author&rdquo; in Julian&rsquo;s
<i>Dictionary of Hymnology</i>, pp. 1638-9, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. <i>Bring, O morn thy music! Night thy starlit silence!</i> <span class="hst">(God Everlasting)</span></p>

Festival, May 30, 1873. Published in <i>The Thought of
God</i>, 1<sup>st</sup> Series, 1885, in 4 st. of 8 l. The most widely
used of the author&rsquo;s hymns.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>5. <i>I hear it often in the dark</i>, <span class="hst">(The Voice of God)</span></p>
<p>Written at Milwaukee in 1870, and published in <i>The
Thought of God</i>, 1<sup>st</sup> Series, 1885. Sometimes it
begins with St. iii, &ldquo;O God within, so close to me,&rdquo;
as in <i>Hys. for Church and Home</i>, Boston, 1895.</p>
<p>6. <i>Praise to God and Thanksgiving</i>, <span class="hst">(Harvest)</span></p>
<p>Written in 1882 for a Harvest Festival at St. Paul,
Minnesota, where he was then a pastor, and included
in <i>The Thought of God</i>, 1<sup>st</sup> Series, 1885. In the Boston
<i>Pilgrim Hymnal</i>, 1904, and in <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>, 1937, it
begins</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t"><i>Praise to God, and thanks we bring</i>,</p>
</div>
<p>7. <i>Sleep, my little Jesus</i>, <span class="hst">(Christmas Carol)</span></p>
<p>Written for the Sunday School, St. Paul, Minnesota, in
1882, and given in <i>The Thought of God</i>, 2<sup>nd</sup> Series, 1894,
as &ldquo;Mary&rsquo;s Manger Song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>8. <i>The Lord is in His holy place</i> <span class="hst">(Dedication of a Place of Worship)</span></p>
<p>Written for the Dedication of the Rev. C. W. Wendte&rsquo;s
Church, Chicago, April 24, 1873, and published in <i>The

popular and widely used of the author&rsquo;s hymns.</p>
<p>9. <i>The morning hangs its signal</i>, <span class="hst">(Morning)</span></p>
<p>This is dated by the author &ldquo;Chicago, July 30, 1886,&rdquo;
and printed in <i>Love to God and Love to Man</i>, being no. 28
of the Chicago &ldquo;Unity Mission&rdquo; series of hymns, n.d.
It is also included in <i>The Thought of God</i>, 2<sup>nd</sup> Series,
1894. Although a morning hymn it is
adapted for use in Advent. It is usually known as &ldquo;The
Crowning Day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>Of the hymns thus listed in Julian&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary</i> Nos. 1,
3, 4, 6, 8 and 9 have been widely used and are included in
<i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>, 1937. No. 1 was written to be set to
J. B. Dykes&rsquo; tune <i>Nicaea</i>, to which it is usually sung. No. 4
is probably the earliest hymn in the English language to give
a religious interpretation of the then novel and controversial
doctrine of evolution. No. 9, as included in <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>,
1937, is attributed to &ldquo;William Channing Gannett and others&rdquo;,
being an arrangement from one of his poems.</p>
<p>Another fine hymn by Dr. Gannett beginning,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>10. <i>God laid his rocks in courses</i>,</p>
<p>is unaccountably missing from the above list in
Julian&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary</i>. It is dated 1888 and was
written for the dedication of the church in Hinsdale
which was erected shortly before his pastorate there
came to an end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>, 1937, also includes as a hymn beginning,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>11. <i>It sounds along the ages</i>,</p>
<p>an arrangement of stanzas from one of Dr. Gannett&rsquo;s
poems entitled &ldquo;The Word of God.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, mention should be made of his part in giving form
to the great hymn beginning</p>
<blockquote>
<p>12. <i>Praise to the living God! All prais&eacute;d be his name!</i></p>
<p>This is a metrical version of the Yigdal, a summary of
the Jewish faith attributed to Daniel Ben Judah who
lived about the 14<sup>th</sup> century A.D. About 1760 Thomas
Olivers, a Methodist preacher visiting a Jewish synagogue
in London, heard it chanted in Hebrew by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
cantor Leoni (Meyer Lyon) to a traditional melody.
Much impressed he secured a prose translation which
he turned into the hymn beginning</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t"><i>The God of Abraham praise</i>,</p>
</div>
<p>to be sung to the same tune, to which he gave the name
Leoni. His version, however, did not follow the original
text at all closely, for he gave it a Christian interpretation.
(A detailed account of this episode will be
found in Julian&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary</i>, pp. 1149-1151.) This hymn
soon became, and has remained, widely popular. In the
1880&rsquo;s Rabbi Max Landsberg of Temple Berith Kodesh in
Rochester, New York, a friend of <a href="#Mann_N">Rev. Newton Mann</a>, <i>q.v.</i>
then minister of the Unitarian Church in Rochester, asked
Mr. Mann if he could not make a metrical version of the
Yigdal in English which would be a more exact translation.
Mr. Mann did so, but not in the metre of the tune
to which the Hebrew text was sung. After Dr. Gannett had
succeeded Mr. Mann in Rochester, Rabbi Landsberg asked
him to recast Mr. Mann&rsquo;s version in the same metre as
the tune. Dr. Gannett did so, and his version in 5 stas.
was included in the Jewish <i>Union Hymnal</i>, 1910, from which,
with one stanza omitted and some other alterations which
in most cases are not improvements, it has come into a
number of Christian hymn books. The unchanged version
in 4 stas. will be found in <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>, 1937,
where it is recorded as &ldquo;Revised version of the Yigdal of
Daniel Ben Judah&rdquo; and the tune is called &ldquo;Yigdal (Leoni)&rdquo;
and is described as &ldquo;Jewish Melody, arr. by Meyer Lyon.&rdquo;
Dr. Gannett never claimed this version as his, and it is
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
now impossible to discover how much of its wording is
due to Mr. Mann&rsquo;s earlier verse, but its poetic perfection
is highly suggestive of Dr. Gannett&rsquo;s craftsmanship,
which assuredly has contributed much to its present form.</p>

1791&mdash;February 9, 1858, Kingston, Massachusetts. He graduated
from Harvard College in 1811, served the College as tutor in
mathematics for two years, and studied in the Harvard Divinity School.
On December 1, 1819, he was ordained minister of the Unitarian
Church in Charleston, South Carolina, which he served with great
distinction until his death, which occurred while on a visit to
Massachusetts. His wife, <a href="#Gilman_C">Caroline Howard Gilman</a>, <i>q.v.</i>, was a
writer noted in her day. He wrote a good many poems and essays,
published in magazines; a book, &ldquo;Memoirs of a New England Village
Choir,&rdquo; 1829, which ran to three editions; and in 1856 a volume
of his miscellaneous essays, entitled &ldquo;Contributions to Literature,
Descriptive, Critical, Humorous, Biographical, Philosophical and
Poetical.&rdquo; His two best known songs were <i>The Union Ode</i>, composed
for the Union party of South Carolina and sung there on July 4,
1831, during the Nullification excitement, and later in the North
during the Civil War; and the college hymn <i>Fair Harvard</i>, which he
wrote in 1836. He had come to Cambridge for the twenty-fifth anniversary
of his graduation and the 200<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the founding
of the College. On the eve of the celebration, having already
an established reputation as a poet, he was asked to write a song
for the occasion and it was sung at the meeting on September 8,
1836, to a tune popular at the time, composed for the song &ldquo;Believe
me, if all those endearing young charms.&rdquo; Harvard gave him the
honorary degree of D.D. in 1837.</p>
<p>He wrote a number of hymns of minor importance.</p>

He later served Unitarian churches in Dallas, Texas, 1904-1909; in
Reading, Massachusetts, 1909-1934; and in Waverley, Massachusetts,
1934-1939. He began to write verse in 1888, and many of his poems
appeared in newspapers and periodicals, some of them being widely reprinted.
His collected poems were published in book form in 1896,
entitled <i>The Golden Shuttle</i>, which reached a fourth edition in 1910.
He then turned to hymn writing, and four of his earliest hymns were
included in <i>The New Hymn and Tune Book</i>, 1914, viz:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. <i>I hear Thy voice, within the silence speaking</i>, <span class="hst">(1913)</span></p>
<p>2. <i>O Lord of life, Thy kingdom is at hand</i>, <span class="hst">(1912)</span></p>
<p>3. <i>O Thou whose gracious presence shone</i> <span class="hst">(Communion) (1912)</span></p>
<p>4. <i>Touch Thou mine eyes, the sombre shadows falling</i>, <span class="hst">(1911)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are also included in <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>, 1937, as are five
later hymns by him, viz:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5. <i>As tranquil streams that meet and merge</i> <span class="hst">(1933)</span></p>
<p>6. <i>From Bethany the Master</i>, <span class="hst">(Palm Sunday) (1935)</span></p>
<p>7. <i>Heir of all the waiting ages</i>, <span class="hst">(Advent) (1937)</span></p>
<p>8. <i>Ring, O ring, ye Christmas bells</i> <span class="hst">(1932)</span></p>
<p>9. <i>The builders, toiling through the days</i> <span class="hst">(Church dedication) (1925)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In April, 1936, he wrote an Easter hymn</p>
<blockquote>
<p>10. <i>Oh, who shall roll the stone away?</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>which first appeared in the Boston <i>Transcript</i>. It is included in
<i>The Hymnal</i>, 1940.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>In his later years he published, or had privately printed,
several small booklets containing these and other poems by him:
<i>Songs of the Spirit</i>, 1932; <i>Songs of Faith and Hope</i>, 1940; <i>Songs
at Sunset</i>, 1951; <i>Songs of a Lifetime</i>, 1953; and <i>In a Rose Garden</i>,
1956. Of these, <i>Songs of a Lifetime</i> contains what he regarded as
his best poems, as well as his latest hymns, among them one widely
used on United Nations Sunday, beginning,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>11. <i>Freedom, thy holy light</i>,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and a fine national hymn,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>12. <i>O my country, land of promise</i>,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A number of his hymns have been included in the hymnals of several
denominations, and No. 2 was translated into Japanese.</p>
<p>Dr. Ham&rsquo;s hymns manifest a deep spiritual insight expressed
with literary craftsmanship of a high order, which make them among
the most notable contributions to American hymnody in the first
half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

<div class="biography" id="Hedge_FH" title="Hedge, Rev. Frederic Henry">
<p><b>Hedge, Rev. Frederic Henry</b>, Cambridge, Massachusetts, December 12,
1805&mdash;August 21, 1890, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Son of
Professor Levi Hedge of Harvard, he was a very precocious child,
ready to enter college at 12 years of age, but his father wisely
sent him to Germany, with a tutor, George Bancroft, later a noted
historian, where he studied in German schools for 5 years. He
then returned to Harvard College, graduating in 1825, followed by
a period of study in Harvard Divinity School, where he became an
intimate friend of R. W. Emerson. He was ordained minister of
the First Congregational Parish (Unitarian) in West Cambridge (now
Arlington) Massachusetts in 1829. In 1835 he moved to Bangor,
Maine, where he served the Independent Congregational Society until
1850, then serving the Westminster Congregational Church, Providence,
Rhode Island, 1850-1856. In the latter year he was called to the
First Parish in Brookline, Massachusetts, which he served until
1872. His removal to Brookline enabled him to serve as a nonresident
professor of ecclesiastical history in the Harvard Divinity
School. He retired from the ministry in 1872 and moved to Cambridge,
where he was appointed professor of German language and literature, retiring
in 1882. He was a man of extraordinary intellectual ability, one
of the most learned of his time, and a pioneer in bringing to this
country an acquaintance with German literature and metaphysics.
Harvard gave him the degree of D.D. in 1852, and that of LL.D. in
1886. He was one of the editors of the <i>Christian Examiner</i>, author
of <i>The Prose Writers of Germany</i>, 1848, of <i>Reason in Religion</i>, 1865,
of a volume of <i>Metrical Translations and Poems</i> in 1888, and of a
large number of essays and sermons. He was president of the
American Unitarian Association 1860-1863. He collaborated with
<a href="#Huntington_FD">Dr. F. D. Huntington</a>, <i>q.v.</i>, in editing <i>Hymns for the Church of
Christ</i>, Boston, 1853, to which he contributed three translations
from the German:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>1. <i>A mighty fortress is our God</i>, <span class="hst">(Ein&rsquo; feste Burg)</span></p>
<p>2. <i>Christ hath arisen!</i> <span class="hst">(Goethe&rsquo;s Faust)</span></p>
<p>3. <i>The sun is still forever sounding</i> <span class="hst">(Goethe&rsquo;s Faust)</span></p>
<p>The Unitarian <i>Hymn and Tune Book for Church and
Home</i>, 1868, includes his translation from the
Latin,</p>
<p>4. <i>Holy Spirit, Fire Divine</i>, <span class="hst">(Veni, Sancte Spiritus)</span></p>
<p>Translated 1862.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His original hymns included in <i>Hymns for the Church of Christ</i>,
1853, are,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5. <i>Beneath thine hammer, Lord, I lie</i>,</p>
<p>Undated but &ldquo;Written at a time of severe trial
and deep depression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>6. <i>Sovereign and Transforming Grace</i>,</p>
<p>Written for the ordination of H. D. Barlow at Lynn,
Massachusetts, December 9, 1829. This fine hymn is
appropriate to a service of worship and, with the
omission of one stanza, has been widely used.</p>
<p>7. <i>&rsquo;Twas in the East, the mystic East</i>,</p>
<p>A Christmas hymn, written about 1853.</p>
<p>8. <i>&rsquo;Twas the day when God&rsquo;s anointed</i>,</p>
<p>Written for a service in Bangor, Maine, held on
Good Friday, 1843, in six stanzas, the last three
of which, beginning</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t"><i>It is finished, Man of sorrows!</i></p>
</div>
<p>had considerable use in Great Britain and this
country. The whole six stanzas were included in
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
Longfellow and Johnson&rsquo;s <i>Book of Hymns</i>, 1846, as
&ldquo;Anonymous.&rdquo; The last three stanzas are in Martineau&rsquo;s
<i>Hymns</i> and in many other collections.</p>
<p>He also wrote a hymn beginning</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">9. <i>Lo! another offering,</i></p>
<p class="t"><i>To Thy courts this day we bring,</i></p>
</div>
<p>for his own ordination at West Cambridge in 1829, which
was also used at the ordination of F. A. Whitney, at
Brighton, Massachusetts, on February 24, 1844, but
which passed into no collections.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All these hymns, and two other religious poems,
are included in Putnam&rsquo;s Singers and <i>Songs of the Liberal Faith</i>.
Most of them had gone out of use by the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century,
but nos. 1, 6 and 8 (beginning <i>It is finished, Man of sorrows</i>,)
are in <i>The New Hymn and Tune Book</i>, 1914, and in <i>Hymns of the
Spirit</i>, 1937.</p>
<p>By far the best known of Hedge&rsquo;s hymns is his fine and
accurate translation of Luther&rsquo;s great chorale <i>Ein&rsquo; feste Burg</i>
(no. 1). This is the version accepted by almost all the Protestant
denominations in this country, whereas in Great Britain Thomas
Carlyle&rsquo;s earlier translation (1831) is generally used, although
James Martineau included Hedge&rsquo;s version in his <i>Hymns of Praise
and Prayer</i>, 1873, mistakenly attributing it to Samuel Longfellow.
Putnam, <i>op. cit.</i>, 214, says that it was first printed in W. H.
Furness&rsquo;s <i>Gems of German Verse</i>, which appeared in Philadelphia,
without date but undoubtedly in the latter part of 1853, a second
edition following in 1859. That Hedge should have sent his translation
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
of the chorale to Furness without delay was natural,
because the two men were close friends with a common interest
in German literature, and Putnam was the younger contemporary
of both, in a position to know that Furness&rsquo;s little book had
appeared on the market a few days, or weeks, ahead of the collection
of hymns which Hedge and F. D. Huntington were editing
and which they published late in 1853 as <i>Hymns for the Church
of Christ</i>.</p>
<p>The earliest record of the hymn, however, is to be
found in the autograph letter (now in the Harvard University
Library) which Hedge wrote to Rev. Joseph H. Allen, his successor
in the pulpit at Bangor, Maine, asking him to recommend hymns for
inclusion in the book on which he and Huntington were working.
This letter is dated &ldquo;Providence, March 27th, 1853.&rdquo; In the
course of it Hedge wrote, &ldquo;I have made a new translation of Luther&rsquo;s
splendid psalm &lsquo;Eine feste Burg ist unser Gott&rsquo; Carlyle&rsquo;s translation
not being available.&rdquo; This statement is followed by the
four stanzas of his translation. That book contained no printed
tunes, only citing the metre at the head of each hymn as a guide
to the organist, but in his letter Hedge goes on with the surprizing
statement, &ldquo;The original is much sung in Germany and therefore
I suppose that it will not be difficult to find a tune for it.&rdquo;
Since he must have become familiar with both the words and the
music of the famous chorale when he was a youthful student in
Germany this remark indicates that the tune was still unknown in
America, and that he took little interest in introducing it.</p>

School in 1847. Entering the Unitarian ministry he served
churches in Newburyport, Massachusetts, 1847-1850, and in
Worcester, Massachusetts, 1852-1858. He was an ardent Abolitionist
and when the Civil War came he entered the Union Army,
in which he rose to the command of a Negro regiment. After the
war he became a man of letters and published several books and
numerous essays. While still a student in the Divinity School
he contributed to the <i>Book of Hymns</i>, 1846, which his friends
Longfellow and Johnson were preparing, four hymns, which they
marked with an asterisk, viz:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. <i>No human eyes Thy face may see</i> <span class="hst">(God known through love)</span></p>
<p>2. <i>The land our fathers left to us</i> <span class="hst">(American Slavery)</span></p>

<p>4. <i>To thine eternal arms, O God</i>, <span class="hst">(Lent)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last two have had considerable use. Both express the pessimistic
mood with which the young man viewed the evils of the time.</p>

use as a hymn,</p>

<div class="biography" id="Holmes_OW" title="Holmes, Oliver Wendell">
<p><b>Holmes, Oliver Wendell</b>, M.D., LL.D., Cambridge, Massachusetts,
August 29, 1809&mdash;October 7, 1894, Boston, Massachusetts. He
graduated from Harvard College in the famous Class of 1829,
studied medicine and became a practitioner in Boston, and was
appointed Professor of Anatomy in the Harvard Medical School
in 1847. Although distinguished as a physician his fame is
that of a man of letters gifted with a sense of humor which
made him one of the wittiest men of his time. Besides important
medical treatises he wrote essays, novels, biographical
sketches, and poetry which brought him a great reputation in
this country and in Great Britain. Much of his poetry is occasional
verse, which he was often called upon to write, such
as his &ldquo;International Ode&rdquo; to be sung to the tune &ldquo;America&rdquo;
(&ldquo;God Save the Queen&rdquo;) on the occasion of the visit of the Prince
of Wales in 1860. Oxford University gave him the honorary degree
of D.C.L. in 1886. He was a member of Kings&rsquo; Chapel, (Unitarian)
Boston, and two of his poems are about that church. He contributed
The <i>Autocrat at the Breakfast Table</i> to the opening issues
of <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, 1857-58, published <i>The Professor at
the Breakfast Table</i> in 1859, <i>The Poet at the Breakfast Table</i> in
1872. He wrote <i>Elsie Venner</i>, 1861, and two other novels. His
poetry was published in <i>Songs in Many Keys</i>, 1861; <i>Humorous Poems</i>,
1865; <i>Before the Curfew</i>, 1888; and in his <i>Complete Poetical Works</i>,
in 1895.</p>
<p>Although he made a greater contribution to American hymnody
than did any other of the &ldquo;New England poets&rdquo; of his era, except
Bryant and Whittier, his hymns were incidental literary by-products,
for he was not primarily a hymn writer. They include:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>1. <i>Angel of peace, thou hast tarried too long</i></p>
<p>Written in 1869.</p>
<p>2. <i>Father of mercies, heavenly Friend</i>,</p>
<p>A prayer in time of war. Undated but between
1861 and 1865.</p>
<p>3. <i>Lead where the banners wave last to the sea</i>,</p>
<p>Written as an American national anthem. It appeared
in his <i>Songs in Many Keys</i>, 1861, entitled &ldquo;Freedom,
our Queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4. <i>Lord of all being, throned afar</i>, <span class="hst">(God&rsquo;s Omnipotence)</span></p>
<p>Included in <i>The Autocrat at the Breakfast Table</i>,
1848, under the title of &ldquo;A Sun-day Hymn.&rdquo; This is
his finest hymn and has had widespread use in many
collections.</p>
<p>5. <i>O Lord of hosts, Almighty King</i>,</p>
<p>Entitled &ldquo;Army Hymn,&rdquo; and published in <i>The Soldier&rsquo;s
Companion</i>, a hand-book of hymns and scripture readings
issued in the fall of 1861, by the American Unitarian
Association, for use by soldiers in the Union Army.
It is a fine hymn, but with several lines directly
referring to the immediate situation which make it
unsuitable for present use and which cannot be altered
or dropped without mutilating the hymn. In the same
collection he wrote an &ldquo;Additional Verse&rdquo; appended to
&ldquo;The Star-Spangled Banner,&rdquo; beginning</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t"><i>When our land is illumined with Liberty&rsquo;s smile</i>,</p>
</div>
<p>6. <i>O Love Divine, that stooped to share</i>,</p>
<p>Written in 1859, a hymn of trust in time of doubt
and sorrow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">7. <i>Our Father, while our hearts unlearn,</i></p>
<p class="t"><i>The creeds that wrong thy name,</i></p>
</div>
<p>Written for the 25<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the Boston
Young Men&rsquo;s Christian Union, May 31, 1893.</p>
<p>8. <i>Thou gracious Power whose mercy lends</i>,</p>
<p>Written in 1869 for the 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary meeting

<div class="verse">

Those two, and no. 1 are included in <i>The Pilgrim Hymnal</i>, 1935,
and nos. 4, 6, 7 and 8 are in the Unitarian <i>New Hymn and Tune

<p><b>Hosmer, Rev. Frederick Lucian, D.D.</b>, Framingham, Massachusetts,
October 16, 1840&mdash;June 7, 1929, Berkeley, California. He
graduated from Harvard College in 1862, and from the Harvard
Divinity School in 1869. In October of that year he was ordained
minister of the First Congregational Church (Unitarian), Northborough,
Massachusetts, where he served for 3 years. He served
the Unitarian Church in Quincy, Illinois, 1872-1877; then spent
sixteen months in Europe, returning late in 1878 to serve the
First Unitarian Church of Cleveland, Ohio, 1878-1892; the Church
of the Unity, St. Louis, Missouri, 1894-1899; and the First Unitarian
Church, Berkeley, California, 1900-1915, where he remained
as minister-emeritus until his death. In 1887 Buchtel College
gave him the degree of Doctor of Divinity.</p>
<p>While in the Divinity School he formed a close life-long
friendship with <a href="#Gannett_WC">William C. Gannett</a>, <i>q.v.</i> Neither wrote any hymns
until early middle life, Dr. Gannett&rsquo;s earliest having been written
in 1873, Dr. Hosmer&rsquo;s in 1875, but thereafter they worked together
for nearly four decades to make a contribution to American hymnody
comparable to that made by <a href="#Longfellow_S">Samuel Longfellow</a>, <i>q.v.</i>, and
<a href="#Johnson_S">Samuel Johnson</a>, <i>q.v.</i>, a generation earlier. Of the two men it has been
well said that &ldquo;Gannett was the better poet, Hosmer the better
hymn writer,&rdquo; and many more of his hymns than of those by Gannett
have come into widespread use.</p>
<p>Working together they edited <i>Unity Hymns and Chorals</i>, published
in 1880, a revised edition of which appeared in 1911.
(<a href="#Blake_JV">J. V. Blake</a>, <i>q.v.</i>, was also an editor of the first, but not of
the revised edition). In 1885 they published a small collection
of their poems entitled <i>The Thought of God in Hymns and Poems</i>,
followed by later collections with the same title, 2<sup>nd</sup> Series 1894,
3<sup>rd</sup> Series 1918. In 1908 Dr. Hosmer gave a series of lectures
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
on hymnody at the Harvard Divinity School, repeated at the
Pacific Unitarian School for the Ministry, in Berkeley, California,
but these have not been published.</p>
<p>Julian&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary</i>, pp. 1650-51, lists 27 hymns by Dr. Hosmer,

</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>This account of Hosmer&rsquo;s hymns, copied verbatim from
Julian&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary</i>, may be accepted as authoritative as to
the date and occasion for each hymn listed, but Canon Julian
presumably added the descriptive notations in brackets, and fell
into minor inaccuracies, as when he wrote <i>Unity Hymns and Carols</i>
for <i>Unity Hymns and Chorals</i> (cf. nos. 3 and 22), and cited the
periodical <i>Unity</i>, published in Chicago, as <i>Chicago Unity</i>. By
way of further clarification it should be noted that the opening
line of no. 12, <i>O beautiful my country</i>, was taken from
J. R. Lowell&rsquo;s great Commemoration Ode, and that Hosmer always
wanted it printed &lsquo;<i>O Beautiful my Country</i>&rsquo;, in recognition of
its source. No. 18 was written for the observance by the Western
Unitarian Conference of the fiftieth anniversary of Emerson&rsquo;s
famous <i>Divinity School Address</i>. The person initialed as &ldquo;T.K.&rdquo;
for whom no. 20 was written on February 6, 1891, probably was
Thomas Kilpatrick, a layman who did much to make possible the
erection of the church in Omaha, which was not dedicated until
December 15 of that year. The person initialled &ldquo;C.W.W.&rdquo;, for
whom no. 27 was written, was Rev. Charles W. Wendte, then minister
of the First Unitarian Church in Oakland, California.</p>
<p>Julian&rsquo;s account of Hosmer&rsquo;s contribution to hymnody, though
no doubt as satisfactory as could be expected at the time it
was written, is incomplete in two respects. The latest hymn
listed is dated 1899, yet at least three earlier hymns by Hosmer
are unaccountably missing, (viz, nos. 32, 33, 41, noted below),
presumably because he neglected to send Julian any information
about them. More important than these are several later occasional
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
hymns which he wrote in the last three decades of his life,
too late for any inclusion in Julian&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary</i>, and which
form a notable addition to the earlier list. Some of them
were included in the revised edition of <i>Unity Hymns and Chorals</i>,
1911, and all of them in <i>The Thought of God</i>, 3<sup>rd.</sup> Series, 1918, as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>28. <i>Across a century&rsquo;s border line</i>,</p>
<p>Written for the centennial commemoration of
W. E. Channing&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;Baltimore Sermon&rdquo; at
the General Unitarian Conference, September 26,

<p>29. <i>All hidden lie the future ways</i>,</p>

<p>30. <i>Forward through the ages, in unbroken line</i>,</p>
<p>A hymn of the church universal, written in 1908

1914, a second stanza, the first line of which is
quoted above, to complete the thought. This composite
two stanza hymn has since been included in <i>The Pilgrim
Hymnal</i>, 1935, and <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>, 1937.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The period of Dr. Hosmer&rsquo;s hymn writing covered more than
40 years (1875-1917) and during the latter half of that time he
was widely recognized by hymn lovers as the most distinguished
hymn writer of his time. Many of his hymns found their way into
the collections of various denominations in both this country
and Great Britain. Canon Dearmer included 8 in the British collection
<i>Songs of Praise</i>, and in the accompanying handbook, <i>Songs of
Praise Discussed</i>, calls the hymn <i>O Thou, in all thy might so far</i>,
(no. 17) &ldquo;this flawless poem, one of the completest expressions
of religious faith,&rdquo; and the hymn <i>Thy kingdom come, on bended
knee</i>, (no. 24) &ldquo;one of the noblest hymns in the language.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>All of Hosmer&rsquo;s hymns in recent use will be found in both
the Unitarian collections&mdash;<i>The New Hymn and Tune Book</i>, 1914,
and <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>, 1937, except where initials indicate
one or the other book, as follows:&mdash;Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 (N.H.T.B.),

<p><b>Howe, Mrs. Julia</b> (<b>Ward</b>), New York, New York, May 27, 1819&mdash;October 17,
1910, Boston, Massachusetts. Married Samuel Gridley Howe on
April 26, 1843. She was a woman with a distinguished personality
and intellect; an Abolitionist and active in social reforms;
author of several books in prose and verse. The latter include
<i>Passion Flower</i>, 1854; <i>Words of the Hour</i>, 1856; <i>Later Lyrics</i>, 1866;
and <i>From a Sunset Ridge</i>, 1896. She became famous as the author
of the poem entitled &ldquo;Battle Hymn of the Republic,&rdquo; beginning,</p>
<p><i>Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord</i>,
which, in spite of its title, was written as a patriotic song
and not as a hymn for use in public worship, but which has been
included in many American hymn books. It was written on November
19, 1861, while she and her husband, accompanied by their
pastor, <a href="#Clarke_JF">Rev. James Freeman Clarke</a>, <i>q.v.</i>, minister of the (Unitarian)
Church of the Disciples, Boston, were visiting Washington
soon after the outbreak of the Civil War. She had seen the
troops gathered there and had heard them, singing &ldquo;John Brown&rsquo;s
body lies a-mouldering in the grave&rdquo; to a popular tune called
&ldquo;Glory, Hallelujah&rdquo; composed a few years earlier by William Steffe
of Charleston, South Carolina, for Sunday School use. Dr. Clarke
asked Mrs. Howe if she could not write more uplifting words for
the tune and as she awoke early the next morning she found the
verses forming in her mind as fast as she could write them down,
so completely that later she re-wrote only a line or two in the
last stanza and changed only four words in other stanzas. She
sent the poem to <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, which paid her $4 and published
it in its issue for February, 1862. It attracted little
attention until it caught the eye of Chaplain C. C. McCabe (later
a Methodist bishop) who had a fine singing voice and who taught
it first to the 122d Ohio Volunteer Infantry regiment to which he
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
was attached, then to other troops, and to prisoners in Libby
Prison after he was made prisoner of war. Thereafter it
quickly came into use throughout the North as an expression
of the patriotic emotion of the period.</p>

<p><b>Huntington, Rt. Rev. Frederic Dan</b>, D.D., Hadley, Massachusetts,
May 23, 1819&mdash;July 11, 1904, Hadley, Massachusetts. He graduated from
Amherst College in 1839 and from the Harvard Divinity School
in 1842. He was minister of the South Congregational Church
(Unitarian), Boston, 1842-1855, and from 1855 to 1859 he was
Professor of Christian Morals and University Preacher at Harvard
College. In 1859 he was ordained priest in the Protestant Episcopal
Church and served as rector of Emmanuel Church in Boston from 1860
to 1869, when he was consecrated Bishop of Central New York. In
1853 he collaborated with <a href="#Hedge_FH">Rev. Frederic Henry Hedge</a>,
<i>q.v.</i>, in editing their Unitarian collection,
<i>Hymns for the Church of Christ</i>, to
which he contributed three hymns,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. <i>O Love Divine, lay on me burdens if Thou wilt</i> <span class="hst">(Supplication)</span></p>
<p>2. <i>O Thou, in whose Eternal Name</i> <span class="hst">(Ordination)</span></p>
<p>3. <i>O Thou that once on Horeb stood</i> <span class="hst">(God in Nature)</span></p>

<p>The hymn beginning</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Father, whose heavenly kingdom lies</i>,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in Longfellow and Johnson&rsquo;s <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>, 1864, is a cento
taken from no. 2. <i>Hymns for the Church of Christ</i> also includes
a good many anonymous hymns, some of which may be by him, though
there is no proof that such is the case. Dr. Huntington also
collaborated with Dr. Hedge in editing a collection of sacred poetry
entitled <i>Elim: Hymns of Holy Refreshment</i>, Boston, 1865, which includes
a funeral hymn beginning</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>So heaven is gathering one by one</i>,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This hymn has been mistakenly attributed to Huntington, but is an
altered form of a hymn by E. H. Bickersteth beginning</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Thus heaven is gathering one by one</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>Although Dr. Huntington is known to have written occasional

He preached in Unitarian pulpits for a few months but was never
ordained as a settled minister; then he studied in the Harvard

After 1883 he spent most of his time in Europe, his last few years
in Italy. As a student at Harvard he was a contemporary of Samuel
Longfellow and Samuel Johnson and contributed three hymns to their

<p><b>Johnson, Rev. Samuel</b>, Salem, Massachusetts, October 10, 1822&mdash;February
19, 1882, North Andover, Massachusetts. He graduated
from Harvard College in 1842 and from the Harvard Divinity School
in 1846. He served from 1853-1870 as minister of the Independent
Church, Lynn, Massachusetts which he organized and which ceased
to exist when he resigned. He refused to identify himself with
any denomination, though in belief he was a Unitarian and in the
public mind was associated with the churches which adhered to the
liberal wing of the Congregational order. He was author of a
book on <i>Oriental Religions</i>, one of the earliest American studies
in the History of Religions. In 1846 he and his classmate in
the Divinity School, <a href="#Longfellow_S">Samuel Longfellow</a>, <i>q.v.</i>, while still students,
prepared their <i>Book of Hymns</i>, because they and some of their
friends thought the Unitarian hymn books then in use were too
traditional. This book appeared in enlarged edition in 1848,
and made a notable contribution to American hymnody in its freshness
of outlook and its inclusion of hymns by hitherto unrecognized
writers, notably John Greenleaf Whittier. Johnson contributed
7 hymns to the edition of 1846, viz:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. <i>Father [Savior] in Thy mysterious presence kneeling</i> <span class="hst">(Worship)</span></p>
<p>2. <i>Go, preach the gospel in my name</i> <span class="hst">(Ordination)</span></p>
<p>3. <i>Lord, once our faith in man no fear could move</i>, <span class="hst">(In Time of War)</span></p>
<p>4. <i>Onward, Christians, though the region</i> <span class="hst">(Conflict)</span></p>
<p>Altered in <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>, 1864, to</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t"><i>Onward, onward though the region</i></p>
</div>
<p>5. <i>Thy servants&rsquo; sandals, Lord, are wet</i> <span class="hst">(Ordination)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the edition of 1848 he included</p>
<blockquote>
<p>6. <i>God of the earnest heart</i>,<span class="hst"> (Trust)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>which he had &ldquo;Written for the Graduating Exercises of the Class
of 1846, in Cambridge Divinity School.&rdquo; In 1864 he and Longfellow
published their second and no less important collection, <i>Hymns
of the Spirit</i>, (not to be confused with the book of the same
title published in 1937 by the American Unitarian Association).
To this volume he contributed 7 more hymns, viz:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>7. <i>City of God, how broad, how far</i>,<span class="hst"> (The Church Universal)</span></p>
<p>8. <i>I bless Thee, Lord, for sorrows sent</i> <span class="hst">(Purification through suffering)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was &ldquo;Written at the request of Dorothea L. Dix for a collection
made by her for the use of an asylum.&rdquo; (Miss Dix was engaged
in a notable reform of institutions for the insane.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>9. <i>Life of Ages, richly poured</i><span class="hst"> (Inspiration)</span></p>
<p>10. <i>Strong-souled Reformer, whose far-seeing faith</i> <span class="hst">(Jesus)</span></p>
<p>11. <i>The Will Divine that woke a waiting time</i> <span class="hst">(St. Paul)</span></p>
<p>12. <i>Thou whose glad summer yields</i>,<span class="hst"> (Worship)</span></p>
<p>13. <i>To light that shines in stars and souls</i>,<span class="hst"> (Dedication of a Place of Worship)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A number of these hymns have had widespread and long-continued use.
Numbers 1, 4, 6, 7, and 9 are included in <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>, 1937,
and stand out as some of the finest examples of American hymnody
in their lyrical quality and depth of religious feeling. A few
of Johnson&rsquo;s hymns have found acceptance also in England, the
most notable example being No. 7, sung at the consecration of
the new Anglican cathedral at Liverpool in 1924, an occasion which
the words fitted to perfection. But, since even the existence of
the obscure minister in Lynn, Massachusetts, was quite unknown to
all but very few of those present, the Samuel Johnson to whom it
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
was attributed was commonly supposed to be the famous 18<sup>th</sup> century
English lexicographer, and the hymn is mistakenly assigned to him
in the latest edition of Bartlett&rsquo;s <i>Familiar Quotations</i>! Following
its use at Liverpool it was sung in Westminster Abbey at a
service for the League of Nations in 1935; at the jubilee service
for the 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the coronation of George V; and was
one of seven hymns included in the special service prepared by
the Archbishops of Canterbury and York for use in parish churches
throughout England at the time of the coronation of George VI.
Probably no other hymn of American authorship is so widely known
or used in British dominions.</p>

studied law, taught school, and tried to make a living at
various other occupations, with small success except in the
field of music where he was regarded as the outstanding singer,
teacher, and composer of his period. He edited <i>Rural Harmony</i>,

tunes of his own composition which can now be identified as

him. There is evidence that he also wrote poetry, including a
number of hymns, some of them perhaps the anonymous ones, otherwise
unknown, included in the above-mentioned song books. The
one hymn which can be attributed to him with assurance is his

professor of Modern Languages and Belles-Lettres in the latter

He became one of the most widely read and beloved poets in the

him was placed in Westminster Abbey. In the strict

<div class="verse">
<p class="t"><i>The Saviour said, &ldquo;Yet one thing more&rdquo;</i></p>
</div>
<p>In spite of the occasion for which it was written
it is not a hymn but a hortatory poem of five stanzas
in a most unusual 10.6.10.6 metre, for which it must
have been difficult to find any singable tune.</p>
<p>7. <i>I heard the bells on Christmas Day</i></p>
<p>This carol was written in 1864, for the Sunday School
of the Unitarian Church of the Disciples, Boston, of
which Rev. James Freeman Clarke was minister. The
entire poem, entitled &ldquo;Christmas Bells,&rdquo; has seven
stanzas, of which 1, 2, 6 and 7 are in <i>The New Hymn
and Tune Book</i>, 1914, in <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>, 1937, and

<p>In 1850 the poet wrote &ldquo;The Ladder of St. Augustine,&rdquo;
a poem in twelve stanzas, based upon a quotation from
Sermon III, De Ascensione, by St. Augustine of Hippo,
&ldquo;De vitiis nostris scalam nobis facimus, si vitia ipsa
calcamus.&rdquo; (We shall make a ladder out of our vices,
if we tread those vices under foot.) The three stanzas
of the hymn are, respectively, the seventh, tenth and
second stanzas of the poem.</p>

<div class="biography" id="Longfellow_S" title="Longfellow, Rev. Samuel">
<p><b>Longfellow, Rev. Samuel</b>, Portland, Maine, June 18, 1819&mdash;October
3, 1892, Portland, was the youngest of the eight
children of Stephen and Zilpah (Wadsworth) Longfellow. Stephen
Longfellow had graduated from Harvard and had become one of the
most prominent citizens of Portland. His son Samuel entered
Harvard with the Class of 1839, just after his brother, Henry
Wadsworth Longfellow, more than twelve years his senior, had
returned from Europe to begin his professorship at Harvard.</p>
<p>Samuel entered the Harvard Divinity School, from
which he graduated in 1846, and served as minister of the Unitarian
Church in Fall River, Massachusetts, 1848-51; the Second
Unitarian Church, Brooklyn, New York, 1853-1860; and the Unitarian
Church, Germantown, Pennsylvania, 1878-1883. In the
intervals between these pastorates he did much occasional
preaching, and, having independent means and no marital ties,
made several prolonged visits to Europe. He had an attractive
personality, was witty and highly intelligent, and was an acceptable
though outspoken preacher, but he is now remembered
for his contribution to American hymnody through the hymns
which he wrote and the books which he edited. His accomplishment
in this field was greater and more lasting than that of
any other American in the middle period of the 19<sup>th</sup> century.
Its development can best be traced in the books which he published.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>The first of these was <i>A Book of Hymns for Public and
Private Devotions</i>, which he and his classmate in the Divinity
School, Samuel Johnson, daringly compiled while still students
in the School. A not improbable story of the origin of the book
reports that their friend, Rev. Francis Parker Appleton, then a
young minister at Peabody, Massachusetts, had complained to them
about the antiquated hymn-book which he found in use in his church,
to which they replied that they would prepare a book for him which
would express the religious aspirations of the rising generation.
The book appeared in 1846, before either of the young editors had
been ordained, and was an immediate success. It was first used
in the First Unitarian Church at Worcester, Massachusetts, where
Longfellow&rsquo;s classmate and lifelong friend, Edward Everett Hale,
had just been ordained at a service for which Longfellow wrote
the ordination hymn, and it was promptly adopted by Theodore Parker
for his congregation in Music Hall. The book was re-published in
somewhat revised and enlarged form in 1848, and ran to 12 editions.
It marked a new epoch in American hymnody because it was the product
of young and adventurous but well-trained minds seeking to give
utterance to the emotions stirred by the intellectual and political
ferment of the times, and because of the new sources to which they
turned. They were the first to see and make use of the hymnic possibilities
of the poems of John Greenleaf Whittier, and to include
in an American hymn-book Newman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lead, kindly Light,&rdquo; which they
had found printed in a newspaper without the author&rsquo;s name, though
they altered the first line to read &ldquo;Send kindly Light,&rdquo; and another
line further down. From their book it passed into other collections,
with variant readings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>In 1859 Longfellow published a little collection entitled
<i>Vespers</i>, hymns for use at the vesper services which he had instituted
in his church in Brooklyn. In 1860 he published <i>A Book
of Hymns and Tunes for the Sunday School, the Congregation, and
the Home</i>, and in 1864 he and Samuel Johnson brought out their
second notable book, <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>, (not to be confused with
the hymn book with the same title published by the Beacon Press
in 1937). This book contained most of the later hymns written by
the two editors, and a good many new hymns by other authors who
were glad to contribute them. Its literary level was higher than
that of their first book, but it had less popular success, in part,
perhaps, because they failed to set the words to tunes, which had
become the common practice in the period since their earlier book
appeared. In 1876 he brought out <i>A Book of Hymns &amp; Tunes for the
Congregation &amp; the Home</i>, a revision of his earlier book with a
similar title, in which several of his earlier hymns appear in
revised form. In 1887 he printed privately <i>A Few Verses of Many
Years</i>.</p>
<p>After his death a small volume entitled <i>Hymns and Verses
by Samuel Longfellow</i> was published in 1894 with a very brief introductory
note by his niece, Miss Alice M. Longfellow. It included
41 hymns which she thought were his, followed by 30 short poems of
no outstanding excellence. Some of the &ldquo;hymns&rdquo; included seem never
to have come into use as such; some of her attributions were mistaken;
she omitted some hymns which he wrote or adapted but cited in his
books as &ldquo;Anonymous&rdquo; because based on the work of others; and she
did not always print the best of extant variant readings. This
book, therefore, must be used with caution in compiling the list
of Longfellow&rsquo;s hymns, whether original or adapted.</p>
<p>Before listing his hymns it should be noted that he wrote
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
or edited several other literary works. In 1853 he and his classmate
Thomas Wentworth Higginson published a beautiful collection
of sea-poems entitled <i>Thalatta</i>. He wrote a memoir of his friend,
Rev. Samuel Johnson, 1883; was the author of a <i>Life of Henry
Wadsworth Longfellow</i>, 1886; and edited <i>Final Memorials of Henry
Wadsworth Longfellow</i> in 1887. A volume of his own <i>Essays and
Sermons</i>, edited by Joseph May, was published in 1894.</p>

<p>5. <i>Every bird that upward springs.</i></p>
<p>Included in <i>Supplement to Bk. Hys.</i>, 1848, attributed
to Neale, and also in Hys. Sp., 1864. It is in fact
S.L.&rsquo;s adaptation of part of a hymn by Neale for St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Day, included in his &ldquo;Hymns for Children&rdquo;,
1842; see pp. 360-1 of the <i>Collected Hymns, Sequences
and Carols of J. M. Neale</i>, 1914. S.L. used stas. 4,
5, 6 and 7 of Neale&rsquo;s hymn in 8 stas. Of the 16 lines
in S.L.&rsquo;s version 9 are taken unchanged from Neale,
6 contain part of Neale&rsquo;s wording, and only 1 is
wholly S.L.&rsquo;s. S.L. writing in 1880 said, &ldquo;I may say
that hymn 585, [i.e. Every bird, etc.] is mine&mdash;I
did not put my name because two lines were not mine&mdash;&ldquo;.
(see H. W. Foote, <i>The Anonymous Hymns of Samuel Longfellow</i>,
Harv. Theol. Rev. Oct., 1917.) This letter
illustrates the fallibility of human memory. In the
32 years which had elapsed since he had adapted Neale&rsquo;s
verses for the <i>Supplement to Bk. Hys.</i> his own contribution
to the final result had come to bulk much larger
than it really was. S.L. was right in ascribing the
hymn to Neale, as he did in 1848 and 1864, tho he might
properly have marked it as &ldquo;Neale, altered.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>6. Father, give thy benediction. <span class="hst">(Dismissal)</span></p>

but included in his H. &amp; V. Listed as &ldquo;Anon.&rdquo; in
the first edition of the <i>Pilgrim Hymnal</i>. Included
in the <i>Isles of Shoals Hymn Book</i>, 1908. (H. W.
Foote, <i>The Anonymous Hymns of Samuel Longfellow</i>,

<p>9. <i>God of Truth! Thy sons should be</i>,</p>
<p>No. 550 in Hys. Sp. 1864, where it is listed as
&ldquo;Anon,&rdquo; because, as he later wrote, it was &ldquo;founded
on a H. of Wesley&rdquo; though &ldquo;nearly all mine.&rdquo; (H. W.
Foote, <i>The Anonymous Hymns of Samuel Longfellow</i>,

<p>Printed in Hys. Sp. 1864 as &ldquo;From Martineau&rdquo; under
title of &ldquo;Be still, and know that I am God.&rdquo; This
is S.L.&rsquo;s versification of a passage from Martineau&rsquo;s
sermon, &ldquo;Silence and Meditation&rdquo;, no. 17 in &ldquo;Endeavors
after the Christian Life,&rdquo; in which Martineau paraphrased
a few sentences in Pascal&rsquo;s &ldquo;Thoughts&rdquo;, no. 72.
Not dated; not included in H. &amp; V. (H. W. Foote,
<i>The Anonymous Hymns of Samuel Longfellow</i>, Harv. Theol.
Rev. October, 1917.)</p>
<p>12. <i>Holy Spirit, Truth [Light] Divine.</i></p>
<p>Included in Hys. Sp. under title &ldquo;Prayer for Inspiration&rdquo;;
also in H. &amp; V., without date. In the introductory
note to H. &amp; V. it is stated that this hymn
&ldquo;bears some resemblance to one by Andrew Reed, but
after careful investigation they appear to be quite
distinct.&rdquo; In spite of this disclaimer it is clear
that the theme of the hymn as a whole, and several
of its lines, are borrowed from the hymn, &ldquo;Holy Ghost,
with light divine&rdquo; by Andrew Reed, 1817. Furthermore,
S.L.&rsquo;s arrangement of this hymn is found in two
different versions, the one in H. &amp; V. beginning, &ldquo;Holy
Spirit, Truth divine,&rdquo; the other, and superior one,
beginning, &ldquo;Holy Spirit, Light divine.&rdquo; It will be
found in this latter form in <i>The New Hymn and Tune
Book</i>, 1914, and in <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>, 1937, in both
of which it is attributed to both Reed and Longfellow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>13. <i>Holy Spirit, source of gladness.</i></p>
<p>S.L.&rsquo;s adaptation of Jacobi and Toplady&rsquo;s version
of Gerhardt&rsquo;s &ldquo;O du allersusste Freude&rdquo;; included
in <i>Supplement to Bk. Hys.</i> 1848, and in altered form
in Hys. Sp. 1864; set down as &ldquo;Anon.&rdquo; in both; not
included in H. &amp; V.</p>
<p>14. <i>I look to Thee in every need</i>, <span class="hst">(Trust)</span></p>
<p>In Hys. Sp., 1864, with title &ldquo;Looking Unto God,&rdquo; and
listed as &ldquo;Anon.&rdquo;, but included in H. &amp; V. as Longfellow&rsquo;s.
He had not claimed it because its opening
stanza was strongly reminiscent of a love-song by
Thomas Haynes Bayly, as indicated by S.L.&rsquo;s pencilled
notation in his copy of Hys. Sp. now in the library
of Union Theological Seminary, New York, reading
&ldquo;V. 1, T. H. Bayley, alt.&rdquo; Bayly (not Bayl&#275;y) (1797-1839)
was an English composer of popular sentimental
songs one of which began,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">I turn to thee in time of need</p>
<p class="t2">And never turn in vain;</p>
<p class="t">I see thy fond and fearless smile</p>
<p class="t2">And hope revives again.</p>
<p class="t">It gives me strength to struggle on,</p>
<p class="t2">Whate&rsquo;er the strife may be;</p>
<p class="t">And if again my courage fail</p>
<p class="t2">Again I turn to thee.</p>
</div>
<p>This song, though one of Bayly&rsquo;s best, is not included
in his collected works, but a copy, with his name as
its author, is in the Harvard University Library. It
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
was published by C. Bradlee, 107 Washington St.,
Boston, n.d., the words set &ldquo;to a favorite
Neapolitan melody&rdquo;, and must have still been well
remembered when S.L. was inspired to transfigure
the thought of its opening stanza by giving it a
profoundly spiritual interpretation. He made no
use of Bayly&rsquo;s second and third stanzas, and changed
the metre from 8.6.8.6. double to six line stanzas,
8.6.8.6.8.8., thus making sure that his words would
be sung to another tune than the &ldquo;Neapolitan melody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>15. <i>In the beginning was the word.</i> <span class="hst">(The Word of God)</span></p>
<p>This was printed in <i>The Liberty Bell</i>, Boston, 1851,
in 6 stanzas of 8 lines, and dated &ldquo;Fall River,
Sept. 1850.&rdquo; Two stanzas are included in Hys. Sp.
1864; also in H. &amp; V., undated.</p>
<p>16. <i>Life of all that lives below.</i></p>
<p>An adaptation from Charles Wesley; not in Bk. Hys.
or Hys. Sp.</p>
<p>17. <i>Life of God, within my soul.</i> <span class="hst">(God in the soul)</span></p>
<p>Only found in H. &amp; V., undated, entitled &ldquo;A Prayer.&rdquo;
4 stas. of 4 l.</p>
<p>18. <i>Light of ages and of nations.</i> <span class="hst">(Inspiration)</span></p>
<p>Dated 1860 in H. &amp; V. in which it begins as above
with title &ldquo;In all ages entering holy souls.&rdquo; It
was first printed, however, in Hys. Sp. 1864 as
&ldquo;God of ages,&rdquo; under title &ldquo;The word of the Lord
abideth forever.&rdquo; 3 stas. of 8 l.</p>
<p>19. <i>Lo! the earth is risen again.</i> <span class="hst">(Easter)</span></p>
<p>In H. &amp; V. the first line reads &ldquo;Lo the earth again
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
is risen,&rdquo; with no date, but Dr. Louis F. Benson
owned a copy of the book in which a ms. note was
appended to this hymn reading</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;In memory of C.J.
<br />July 6, 1864
<br />May 12, 1886.
<br />Written for the first anniversary of her death, May 12, 1887.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several other lines besides the opening one have
been re-written, presumably by S.L., to make the
later and improved version of the hymn included
in <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>, 1937.</p>
<p>20. <i>Love for all! and can it be?</i> <span class="hst">(The Prodigal Son)</span></p>

<p>There are also five hymns, composite in origin and listed
as &ldquo;Anonymous&rdquo; in Hys. Sp. 1864, which in style and sentiment
so closely resemble S.L.&rsquo;s writings as to suggest that he gave
them the form in which they are there printed, viz:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">47. <i>As darker, darker fall around</i></p>
<p class="t"><i>The shadows of the night.</i></p>
</div>
<p>This is printed in 6 stas., the first four of
which are taken from &ldquo;The Hymn of the Calabrian
Shepherds,&rdquo; printed in William Young&rsquo;s <i>Catholic
Choralist</i>, 1842, but there beginning, &ldquo;Darker and
darker fall around.&rdquo; The 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> stas. may
be by S.L. since he referred to this hymn as it
appeared in Hys. Sp. as &ldquo;founded upon the Hymn
of the Calabrian Shepherds,&rdquo; tho he did not state
that he wrote them. (H. W. Foote, <i>The Anonymous
Hymns of Samuel Longfellow</i>; and Julian, <i>Dictionary</i>,
p. 1627.)</p>
<p>48. <i>Come, thou Almighty Will</i></p>
<p>This hymn in three stanzas was included as Anon.
in Longfellow and Johnson&rsquo;s <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
1864. Its theme was obviously suggested by
Ray Palmer&rsquo;s five stanza translation of the
12<sup>th</sup> century Latin hymn <i>Veni Sancte Spiritus</i>,
beginning <i>Come, Holy Ghost, in love</i>, published
in 1858, from which three lines are borrowed
intact, with as many more which only slightly
alter Palmer&rsquo;s words. Since the religious
outlook expressed is characteristic of Samuel
Longfellow, and the hymn first appeared in <i>Hymns
of the Spirit</i>, it seems certain that he was the
author but listed it as <i>Anon</i>, because of its
composite form. It was included in several
later Unitarian hymn books, most recently in
<i>The New Hymn and Tune Book</i>, 1914, and in <i>Hymns
of the Spirit</i>, 1937. (J. 1623 H.W.F.)</p>
<p>49. <i>Give forth thine earnest cry.</i></p>
<p>Printed in three 4-line stas. There is no
evidence as to the authorship of this hymn, but
its sentiment is completely in line with Longfellow&rsquo;s.
Included in <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>, 1864,
and in <i>The New Hymn and Tune Book</i>, 1914.</p>
<p>50. <i>God is in his holy temple.</i></p>
<p>Printed in four 4-line stas. One line is almost
identical with one found in S.L.&rsquo;s earlier hymn
&ldquo;Written for the dedication of the New Chapel of
the First Parish, Haverhill, Mass.&rdquo;, which had
had no use beyond the occasion for which it was
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
written, but which Miss Longfellow included in
<i>Hymns and Verses</i>. The recurrence of this line
in the hymn here listed suggests the probability
that the whole hymn is by S.L. though he preferred
to cite it as &ldquo;Anon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>51. <i>Supreme disposer of the heart.</i></p>
<p>This appeared in the 1848 edition of the <i>Book of
Hymns</i>, where it is cited as from &ldquo;Breviary&rdquo;, and
was included by Miss Longfellow in <i>Hymns and Verses</i>
with the same citation. She probably assumed that
it was a translation by S.L. from a Latin hymn.
It is, however, a largely rewritten version of
John Chandler&rsquo;s translation of the hymn <i>Supreme
motor cordium</i>, in his <i>Hymns of the Primitive Church</i>,
1837, p. 31. Longfellow retained the general pattern
of Chandler&rsquo;s five stanzas, and kept a few of his
lines unchanged, or altered by only a word or two,
but rewrote the rest, the fourth and fifth stas.
being wholly S.L.&rsquo;s, differing from Chandler&rsquo;s in
both phrase and significance, and even further from
the Latin original.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Isles of Shoals Hymn Book</i>, 1908, contains a hymn in two
stanzas, 8.6.8.6.D., beginning</p>
<blockquote>
<p>52. <i>The heavens thy praise are telling</i>,</p>
<p>Given as &ldquo;Anon.&rdquo; but <a href="#Marean_E">Mrs. Emma Marean</a>, <i>q.v.</i>, who
was exceptionally well informed about that book,
attributed it to &ldquo;Spitta-Longfellow,&rdquo; i.e., by
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
S. Longfellow based on a German hymn by C. J. P.
Spitta. It is possible that this is the case but
the original by Spitta has not been traced and
Longfellow did not claim this arrangement.</p>

<p><b>Lowell, James Russell</b>, LL.D., Cambridge, Massachusetts,
February 22, 1819&mdash;August 12, 1891, Cambridge. Son of
Rev. Charles Lowell, minister of the West Church (Unitarian),
Boston, he graduated from Harvard College in 1838, and entered
upon a literary career as a poet, essayist and scholar. In 1855
he succeeded H. W. Longfellow as Professor of Belles Lettres at
Harvard and spent the next two years in Europe to increase his
knowledge of southern European languages and literature. On
his return he was the first editor of <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>,
1857-1862, then editor of <i>The North American Review</i>, 1863-1872.
He was United States Minister to Spain, 1877-1880, and to Great
Britain, 1880-1885. He wrote many essays, addresses and poems.
These last were published in a succession of volumes, &ldquo;A Year&rsquo;s
Life,&rdquo; 1841; &ldquo;Poems,&rdquo; 1844-1854; &ldquo;The Vision of Sir Launfal,&rdquo;
1845; &ldquo;A Fable for Critics,&rdquo; 1845; &ldquo;The Biglow Papers,&rdquo; 1848 and
1867; &ldquo;The Commemoration Ode,&rdquo; 1865; &ldquo;Under the Willows,&rdquo; 1868;
and later volumes, his &ldquo;Complete Poems&rdquo; appearing in 1895. Though
some of his poems show deep religious feeling he made only a slight
and indirect contribution to American hymnody, writing only one
hymn and one Christmas carol, although stanzas quarried out of
his poems have been used as hymns, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">1. <i>Men who boast it is that ye</i></p>
<p class="t"><i>Come of fathers brave and free</i>,</p>
</div>
<p>The 1<sup>st</sup>, 3<sup>d</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> stanzas of his anti-slavery poem,
&ldquo;Stanzas on Freedom,&rdquo; written in 1844. It was included
in this form in <i>The Soldier&rsquo;s Companion</i>, 1861, in Longfellow and Johnson&rsquo;s <i>Hymns of the
Spirit</i>, 1864, and in part in <i>Songs of the Sanctuary</i>,
N. Y. 1865, beginning</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t"><i>They are slaves who will not choose</i>,</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>2. <i>Once to every man and nation</i>,</p>
<p>In December, 1844, Lowell wrote a poem in 18 stas.
of 5 l. entitled &ldquo;The Present Crisis,&rdquo; a protest
against the war with Mexico. The English hymnnologist,
Rev. V. Garrett Horder, took from this poem
a number of lines sufficient to make a hymn of
4 stas. which he included, with a few verbal alterations,
in his <i>Hymns Supplemental</i>, 1896, and then in
his <i>Treasury of Hymns</i>. The <i>English Hymnal</i> included
the hymn in 1906, and from this it passed into many
collections. In the form commonly used in this
country, stanza 1 is that of sta. 5 in the original
poem; sta. 2 is that of original sta. 11; sta. 3 is
no. 13, original; and sta. 4, part of sta. 6 and
part of sta. 8 original. In this form it has had
considerable use in this country.</p>
<p>3. <i>Our house, our God, we give to Thee</i>,</p>
<p>Hymn for the dedication of the First Church (Unitarian),
Watertown, Massachusetts, on August 3, 1842,
in a service in which Rev. Samuel Ripley made the
dedicatory prayer and the sermon was preached by
Rev. Convers Francis, who had recently left Watertown
to accept a professorship at the Harvard Divinity
School. Lowell&rsquo;s Cambridge residence at &ldquo;Elmwood&rdquo;
was only a short distance from the Watertown line,
and Miss Maria White, whom he married in 1844, belonged
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
to the Watertown parish, which suggests the possibility
that it was she who persuaded him to
write the hymn. It was not included in any of
his published works but has been found on the
only known copy of the printed program of the
service, now owned by the Huntington Library,
San Marino, Pasadena, California. It probably
was used only on the occasion for which it was
written.</p>
<p>4. <i>The ages one great minster seem</i>,</p>
<p>Taken from a poem &ldquo;Godminster Chimes&rdquo; which was
&ldquo;Written in aid of a chime of bells for Christ
Church, Cambridge,&rdquo; and published in &ldquo;Under the
Willows,&rdquo; 1868. From this poem of 7 stas. 8 l.,
enough lines have been selected and arranged, with
a few verbal alterations, to make a hymn on the
theme of the Church Universal, in 4 stas. of 4 l.</p>
<p>5. <i>What means this glory round our feet?</i></p>
<p>A Christmas carol written in 1866 &ldquo;For the children
of the Church of the Disciples&rdquo;, Boston, (Unitarian),
of which <a href="#Clarke_JF">Rev. James Freeman Clarke</a>, <i>q.v.</i>, was minister.

as the Yigdal. His verse, which has not survived, was later
recast by <a href="#Gannett_WC">Rev. W. C. Gannett</a>, <i>q.v.</i>, to form the great hymn</p>

<p><b>Norton, Prof. Andrews</b>, Hingham, Massachusetts, December 31, 1786&mdash;September
18, 1853, Newport, Rhode Island. He graduated from
Harvard in 1804. In 1811 he was appointed tutor in the College,
in 1813 librarian and Lecturer on the Bible, and in 1819 Professor
of Sacred Literature in the Harvard Divinity School, a post which
he resigned in 1830 to devote himself to literary and theological
pursuits. In 1837 he published the first volume of his famous
book <i>The Genuineness of the Gospels</i>, followed in 1844 by the
second and third volumes. This was the earliest scholarly work
on the New Testament by an American author, and expressed the
conservative Unitarian thought of his period. He wrote several
other books, and numerous articles. His few poems were printed
in a small volume soon after his death, including six hymns,
some of which have had considerable use.</p>

Massachusetts on August 24, 1810, and died in Florence,
Italy, on May 10, 1860. He entered Harvard College in
1830, but did most of his work at home, and studied in the
Harvard Divinity School, 1834-1836. In 1840 he was granted
the degree of A.M. from Harvard. Entering the ministry he
served the Unitarian Church in West Roxbury, Massachusetts,
1837-1846, and the 28<sup>th</sup> Congregational Society, Boston,
1846-1860. He was a famous preacher; author of numerous
printed discourses on social and religious problems; and
one of the earliest American translators of current German
theological literature. He wrote a few poems, none intended
for use as hymns, but Longfellow and Johnson took one of his
sonnets and, by eliminating two lines, transformed it into a
hymn of 3 stanzas of 4 lines each beginning,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>O thou great Friend of all the sons of men</i>,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which they included in their <i>Book of Hymns</i>, 1846. It has had
widespread and long continued use in American hymn-books and
to some extent in England. Twelve of Parker&rsquo;s poetical pieces
are included in A. P. Putnam&rsquo;s <i>Singers and Songs of the Liberal
Faith</i>. Biographies of Parker have been written by John Weiss,

<p><b>Pierpont, Rev. John</b>, Litchfield, Connecticut, April 6, 1785&mdash;August
27, 1866, Medford, Massachusetts. He graduated from
Yale College in 1804, studied law, and in 1812 set up practice
in Newburyport, Massachusetts, but later turned to the ministry
and graduated from the Harvard Divinity School in 1818. That
fall he became minister of the Hollis Street Church (Unitarian)
in Boston, which he served till 1840, when a sharp controversy
over his outspoken attacks on intemperance, slavery and other
social evils led to his resignation. In the same year he published
his <i>Poems and Hymns</i>, which included his temperance and
anti-slavery poems and songs, and of which a later edition appeared
in 1854. He also wrote a number of excellent school
books. In 1845 he became minister of the Unitarian Church at
Troy, New York, and in 1849 of the First Parish in Medford,
Massachusetts, which he served until 1859, when he retired.
With the outbreak of the Civil War he became an Army chaplain
and was later employed in the Treasury Department at Washington.
He died suddenly while on a visit to Medford.</p>
<p>He was the maternal grandfather of J. Pierpont Morgan of
New York, who was named for him, but it would be hard to find
a greater contrast than that offered by the careers of the hymn-writing
reformer and his grandson, the financial magnate.</p>
<p>In his own day Pierpont&rsquo;s hymns brought him a wide reputation.
Thus Putnam, in his <i>Singers and Songs of the Liberal
Faith</i>, 1873, says, &ldquo;Mr. Pierpont was one of the best hymn writers
in America. He was a genuine poet, as well as a powerful preacher
and stern reformer.&rdquo; Today he occupies a much more modest place
in American hymnody. None of his hymns attained a very high level
of excellence. Most of them are respectable verse, written in
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
response to frequent requests for hymns for special occasions,

period.</p>

He graduated from
Harvard in 1707. After voyages to Barbadoes and a stay of
several years in England he returned to Boston and in 1717 was
ordained as colleague of Rev. Joseph Sewall, minister of the
Old South Church. His career was marked by frequent controversies
and by his <i>Chronological History of New England</i>, based on his
great collection of rare documents dating from the early years
of the Colony. This priceless collection was unfortunately
dispersed and much of it lost after his death. During his
ministry the Tate and Brady version of the Psalms was gradually
replacing the <i>Bay Psalm Book</i> in New England, but his parishioners
clung to the old book. He persuaded them to let him revise it,
which he did, improving or modernizing the verse and printing
after the Psalms &ldquo;an addition of Fifty other Hymns on the most
important subjects of Christianity.&rdquo; It included one hymn by
himself beginning</p>
<blockquote>

<p class="t0"><i>Of Saints and Angels, we shall rise</i><span class="hst"> (The Resurrection)</span></p>

<p>His collection was published in 1758 and was first used in the
Old South Meeting House on the Sunday following his death. Its
use there continued for another 30 years, but it was not adopted
elsewhere, the <i>Bay Psalm Book</i> being by that time generally superseded
by collections of <i>Watts and Select</i>.</p>

<p>He wrote a good many poems on religious themes, which were

<p><b>Savage, Rev. Minot Judson</b>, D.D., Norridgewock, Maine, June 10,
1841&mdash;May 22, 1918, Boston, Massachusetts. His parents were
strictly orthodox Congregationalists whose resources were meagre,
but a generous benefactor made it possible for him to enter
Bangor Theological Seminary, from which he graduated in 1864.
He served as a Congregational minister in California, Massachusetts
and Missouri, but, having become acquainted with the works
of Darwin and Herbert Spencer, he transferred his membership to
the Unitarian denomination in 1872 and became minister of the
Third Unitarian Church in Chicago. Two years later he accepted
a call to Unity Church in Boston, which he served until 1896
when he moved to New York as minister of the Church of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
Messiah. He was one of the earliest advocates of a religious
interpretation of the doctrine of evolution, a bold thinker and
forceful speaker in great demand, and the author of many books
and printed sermons. In 1883 he published <i>Sacred Songs for
Public Worship; a Hymn and Tune Book</i>, with music arranged by
Howard M. Dow, for use in Unity Church. It contained 195 hymns
and songs, 42 of which were from his own pen. It had the shortcomings
of a &ldquo;one-man book&rdquo; and was musically nearer akin to the
typical gospel song-book than was usual in Unitarian hymn-books,
and it had little use outside his own congregation. Several of
his hymns passed into other collections in England and America,
viz:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. <i>Dost thou hear the bugle sounding</i>, <span class="hst">(Duty)</span></p>
<p>2. <i>Father, we would not dare to change thy purpose</i> <span class="hst">(Prayer)</span></p>
<p>3. <i>God of the glorious summer hours</i>, <span class="hst">(New Year)</span></p>
<p>4. <i>How shall come the kingdom holy</i> <span class="hst">(Coming of the kingdom)</span></p>
<p>5. <i>O God, whose law is in the sky</i> <span class="hst">(Consecration to Duty)</span></p>
<p>6. <i>O star of truth, down shining</i>, <span class="hst">(Devotion to Truth)</span></p>
<p>7. <i>Seek not afar for beauty</i>, <span class="hst">(God in Nature)</span></p>
<p>8. <i>The God that to our fathers revealed his holy will</i>,</p>

<p><b>Sears, Rev. Edmund Hamilton</b>; Sandisfield, Massachusetts
April 6, 1810&mdash;January 16, 1876, Weston, Massachusetts.
Studied at Union College, graduated from the Harvard Divinity
School in 1837. Ordained minister of the First Parish (Unitarian)
of Wayland, Massachusetts, on February 20, 1839. He
soon after went to Lancaster, Massachusetts; returned to Wayland,
1848-1864; and was minister of the First Parish, Weston, Massachusetts,
1866 until his death. He was author of many books and
printed sermons, and of a good many poems, often hymns supplementary
to his sermons. None of these, however, have come into
general use, and his reputation as a hymn writer is based on his
two widely used Christmas hymns, found in many hymn books. The
first,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Calm on the listening ear of night</i>,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>was written in 1839. It was included as &ldquo;Anon.&rdquo; in <i>The Christian
Psalter</i>, published in 1841 by Sears&rsquo; friend, <a href="#Lunt_WP">Rev. W. P. Lunt</a>, <i>q.v.</i>
of Quincy, Massachusetts. In the <i>New Hymn and Tune Book</i>, 1914,
the second line of sta. 6</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Saviour now is born!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>was changed to read</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Prince of Peace is born!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but the original reading was restored in <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>, 1937.
His second hymn,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>It came upon the midnight clear</i>,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>was written in 1849. One tradition about it reports that it was
written at Mr. Lunt&rsquo;s request and was first used at the Christmas
celebration of the Sunday School in Quincy in that year. Sta. 5
of this hymn</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">For lo! the days are hastening on</p>
<p class="t">By prophet bards foretold,</p>
<p class="t0">When with the ever-circling years</p>
<p class="t">Comes round the age of gold;</p>
<p class="t0">When peace shall over all the earth</p>
<p class="t">Its ancient splendors fling,</p>
<p class="t0">And the whole world give back the song</p>
<p class="t">Which now the angels sing</p>
</div>
<p>has appeared in re-written forms more than once because its
&ldquo;backward look&rdquo; to a golden age is not Biblical but is derived
from the Fourth Eclogue of the poet Virgil. In the Episcopal
<i>Hymnal</i> of 1874 this is altered to read</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">For lo, the days are hastening on</p>
<p class="t">By prophets seen of old,</p>
<p class="t0">Till with the ever circling years</p>
<p class="t">Shall come the time foretold,</p>
<p class="t0">When the new heaven and earth shall own</p>
<p class="t">The Prince of Peace their King- - - -</p>
</div>
<p>and this version was reprinted in the Episcopal hymnals of 1892
and 1916, and passed into other collections. In the <i>Hymnal</i>, 1940,
it was again altered to read</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">For lo, the days are hastening on</p>
<p class="t">By prophets seen of old,</p>
<p class="t0">When with the ever circling years</p>
<p class="t">Shall come the time foretold</p>
</div>
<p>These alterations may have brought the hymn into closer accord
with orthodox theology, but at the expense of some of its poetic
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
beauty.</p>
<p>Two patriotic songs by Sears were included in the army
hymn book, <i>The Soldier&rsquo;s Companion</i>, 1861. One headed &ldquo;A Psalm
of Freedom&rdquo; begins,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Still wave our streamer&rsquo;s glorious folds</i>,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other is headed &ldquo;Song of the Stars and Stripes,&rdquo; and
begins,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>We see the gallant streamer yet</i>,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neither has any great merit, though both may have served the
purpose for which they were written.</p>

<p><b>Ware, Rev. Henry, Jr.</b>, D.D., Hingham, Massachusetts, April 21,
1794&mdash;September 22, 1843, Framingham, Massachusetts. His
family was for three generations an outstanding one in the
liberal ministry; his father, Dr. Henry Ware, Sr., was called
in 1805 from a pastorate in Hingham to serve as Hollis Professor
of Divinity at Harvard; his younger brother, William Ware, was
the first minister of what is now All Souls Church, New York; and
his son, J. F. W. Ware, was later the minister of Arlington Street
Church, Boston. Henry Ware, Jr. graduated with high honors from
Harvard in 1812, and after teaching for two years at Phillips
Exeter Academy returned to Cambridge, to continue his theological
studies. He was licensed to preach on July 31, 1815, but was not
ordained as minister of the Second Church in Boston (Unitarian)
until January 1, 1817. Never vigorous in body, he offered his
resignation in 1829, but the congregation refused to accept it,
appointing R. W. Emerson to be assistant minister. In 1830, however,
he resigned, to accept an appointment as Professor of Pulpit
Eloquence and Pastoral Care at the Harvard Divinity School, a
position which he held till 1842. He then moved from Cambridge
to Framingham, Massachusetts, where he died a few months later.
Harvard gave him the degree of Doctor of Divinity in 1834. In
spite of ill health he wrote much, and he was a greatly beloved
teacher, whose saintly character commanded the highest respect.
For several years he edited the <i>Christian Disciple</i>, established
in 1813, and he was author of many printed books, addresses and
sermons, listed in the <i>Memoir</i> of him, published by his brother,
Dr. John Ware, in 1846. His collected works were published in
four volumes in 1847, the first volume including his occasional
poems and his hymns. Some of these last reached a high standard
<span class="pb" id="Page_230">230</span>
of excellence and brought him wide recognition in the liberal
churches of Great Britain as well as in this country. No less
than eight pieces of his verse were included in <i>Lyra Sacra
Americana</i>, published by the British Religious Tract Society in
1868. His hymns are some of the choicest poetical expressions
of liberal religious thought in the first period of American
Unitarian hymnody, but almost all have dropped out of present use.
Most of them will be found in Putnam&rsquo;s <i>Singers and Songs</i>, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. <i>All nature&rsquo;s works His praise declare</i>, <span class="hst">(Worship)</span></p>
<p>Headed &ldquo;On Opening an Organ&rdquo; and dated November 9,
1822. In view of the almost universal use of organs
in modern churches it is rather surprizing that this
should be a well-nigh unique example of a hymn for
the dedication of such an instrument. It is also a
good general hymn of worship. It was included in
Horder&rsquo;s British <i>Congregational Hymns</i>, 1884, and in a
number of American Unitarian collections.</p>
<p>2. <i>Around the throne of God, the host angelic sings</i>,</p>
<p>A hymn of &ldquo;Universal Praise,&rdquo; based on Revelation IV,
2, 3; XV, 3. Dated 1823 and published in the <i>Christian

used, perhaps because of its metre, 6.6.6.6.4.4.4.4.</p>
<p>3. <i>Father of earth and heaven, Whose arm upholds creation</i>, <span class="hst">(Thanksgiving for Divine Mercies)</span></p>

<p>Written for the ordination of Jared Sparks, the
historian, as minister of the First Unitarian
Church, Baltimore, Maryland, May 5, 1819, but

most widely used of Ware&rsquo;s hymns.</p>

<p>Dated 1817, and published in the <i>Christian Disciple</i>

<p>Written for the Centennial Celebration of the Boston
Thursday Lecture, October 17, 1833. It is a quasi-national
hymn in praise of the Pilgrim Fathers. Included in
Hedge and Huntington&rsquo;s <i>Hymns for the Church of Christ</i>
and in <i>Lyra Sacra Americana</i>.</p>

in Dale&rsquo;s <i>English Hymn Book</i>, 1874.</p>
<p>11. <i>Oppression shall not always reign</i>, <span class="hst">(Anti-Slavery Song)</span></p>
<p>Dated March 15, 1843, it is the last of the author&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_232">232</span>
writings in verse. In its original form it was a
poem in several stanzas unsuited for use as a hymn,
but 3 stanzas, beginning as above, had been taken
from it, altered and transposed, and thus adapted
for worship. Stanzas one and two were included in
Hedge and Huntington&rsquo;s <i>Hymns for the Church of Christ</i>
and in Longfellow and Johnson&rsquo;s <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>,
1864.</p>
<p>12. <i>To prayer, to prayer, for morning breaks</i>, <span class="hst">(Prayer)</span></p>

entitled &ldquo;Seasons of Prayer,&rdquo; printed in full in <i>Lyra
Sacra Americana</i> and in Putnam, <i>Singers and Songs</i>,
from which at least three variant centos were in use
in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. One beginning with the first
line, as above, adapting it for morning worship, was
included in Lunt&rsquo;s <i>Christian Psalter</i>, 1841, and in
later collections. Another beginning with the second
stanza</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t"><i>To prayer, the glorious sun is gone</i>,</p>
</div>
<p>was adapted for evening worship. A third selection,
beginning with the third stanza of the poem,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t"><i>To prayer! for the day that God hath blest</i>,</p>
</div>
<p>was included in Hedge and Huntington&rsquo;s <i>Hymns for the

to local newspapers. On May 17, 1865, the <i>South
Danvers Wizard</i> published his hymn beginning</p>

<p>and republished it on May 8, 1867, with a note reading &ldquo;Some

for our columns by H. O. Wiley, Esq. Since then it has traversed
the country in all directions, without any credit being given
either to our paper or to the author. We reproduce it from a

<a href="#Williams_VC">Velma C. Williams</a>, <i>q.v.</i>, in compiling her <i>Hymnal: Amore Dei</i>, 1890,
revised edition 1897. A few of his hymns appeared in this book

married Frederick L. E. Willis, M.D., of Boston, in 1858.
She was for some years one of the editors of <i>The Banner of
Light</i>, Boston, and of <i>Tiffany&rsquo;s Monthly Magazine</i>, and was
a frequent contributor to these and other periodicals. She
wrote a number of hymns, one of which, beginning,</p>

</blockquote>
<p>was published in <i>Tiffany&rsquo;s Monthly</i> in 1859. In Longfellow
and Johnson&rsquo;s <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>, 1864, it was considerably
rewritten, with the opening line changed to read,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Father, hear the prayer we offer</i>,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and was cited as &ldquo;Anon.&rdquo; This 1864 text came into considerable
use in various collections in England, and was included in <i>The
English Hymnal</i> as late as 1906. It has also had wide use in
America and will be found in almost all Unitarian hymn books
since 1864, most recently in the <i>New Hymn and Tune Book</i>, 1914,
and in <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>, 1937.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
